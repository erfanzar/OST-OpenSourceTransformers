 <|endoftext|> Hello, I recently found out that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I never thought of that before, have you? <|endoftext|> I guess the other types don't need one. I don't think jellyfish even have bones, and there's one species that's believed to be immortal

 <|endoftext|> Have you heard about the hs teacher in FL who had students help him drown raccoons in class? <|endoftext|> Yes.  That must have been traumatic for the kids and against the law too.
 <|endoftext|> Hi. Do you like trivia about the ocean? Did you know there is breed of jellyfish that is immortal? <|endoftext|> Actually I do, I read about that jellyfish, when it sense danger it regresses in age and becomes a child, grows until more danger, regresses, really crazy.

 <|endoftext|> Hello there! Do you use Reddit? <|endoftext|> I do sometimes.  Did you hear about the lawn shaming incident with Dr. Green lawncare?
 <|endoftext|> I cry when I see the internet being used to shame anything or anyone.  How could that be useful? <|endoftext|> I agree. What a waste.

 <|endoftext|> Do you like soccer? <|endoftext|> I'm not usually a fan, but I do like the watching The World Cup. I'm not liking the Video Assistant Referees though!
 <|endoftext|> Hey there! Did you know that Bill Nye "the science guy" got his starts in entertainment by winning a Steve Martin look-alike contest? Haha!

 <|endoftext|> I think electricity is the civilizing force of our world. <|endoftext|> I too find electricity interesting. I was sad to hear of the death of Frances L. Lloyd, she was a scientist who helped come up with the concept of the volt.

 <|endoftext|> Hi! Do you ever watch soccer? <|endoftext|> You mean football!! Yes I love it.

Apparently New York's area code (212) was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. <|endoftext|> Hi, I have heard that, but it's been so long since I've seen a rotary phone I'm not really sure it's true. It's like how they say you can't separate 2 phonebooks if you overlap them together. 
 <|endoftext|> Hi , do you like to travel? <|endoftext|> I do. I don't do it often enough but I really love going to new places. Did you know that instead of fetching baggage faster, airports just make you walk longer. It helps to stop the complaints.

 <|endoftext|> hi, do you enjoy reading? <|endoftext|> I do, do you read much?

 <|endoftext|> What do you think about Pluto not being a Planet? To me it seems kind of disrespectful.  <|endoftext|> I think it does too. I will always think of Pluto as a planet.  There's a lot of odd things with planets. Uranus rotates on it's side so should that mean it's not a planet?
 <|endoftext|> Hi there! Do you like Star Wars? <|endoftext|> Hi! I don't though I do have respect for it. It's the second highest grossing film series of all time.

 <|endoftext|> I've never been mattress shopping, but there's a new company that's opening a store and offering complimentary naps. I think that's a good way to ensure customer satisfaction <|endoftext|> Best way to experience the product is to take it for a test drive. It's on Broadway. That's probably a pretty nice part of Manhattan.
 <|endoftext|> Do you like drama shows and movies? <|endoftext|> Sure! I enjoy both dramas and comedies. What about you?
 <|endoftext|> Do you know much about computers? <|endoftext|> An average amount, I suppose. How about you?

 <|endoftext|> Good Morning.  Just finished placing an order with Amazon.  Their founder, Jeff Bezos, has been in the news a lot lately. <|endoftext|> Yeah. Even with giving up half his stuff, he'll still be in the top 10 richest list...
 <|endoftext|> What do you think about John Candy's quote about not being the heat but the humidity? <|endoftext|> I agree with that.  The humidity is what makes it hard,  it feel just thick,  where as heat is just crazy hot.  Do you know much about the sun?  The sunset on Mars is actually blue!!!  Amazing! 
 <|endoftext|> Hello! How are you tonight? <|endoftext|> I am doing great, just searching some stuff on Amazon that I may buy, how about you?

 <|endoftext|> Good Morning!  One of my kids is doing a science project on the Sun this week.  The magnitude of the sun is mind boggling!!! <|endoftext|> The magnitude of the whole universe is mind boggling. It's hard to comprehend that the sun is much smaller than many of the other stars even in our own galaxy.
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you doing this evening? Are you interesting in our bright yellow friend, the sun, who comes every day to say hi to us? <|endoftext|> Hey there, pretty well here and how are you? Yes I am very much but I will have to say the white friend that appears to be yellow.
 <|endoftext|> Good evening!  Are you a football fan? <|endoftext|> I am, although Im a bigger fan of college than the NFL.  How about you?

 <|endoftext|> How's it going? did you know the Sun is an almost perfect sphere of hot plasma? <|endoftext|> Hi there. It must be so hot. It is only perceived as yelling because of atmospheric scattering.

 <|endoftext|> Hi! Do you watch the Bachelor? I could watch it all day... it's so great how they always have a villian and drama <|endoftext|> I never have, no. I can see how that's entertaining, but it kinda kills the idea that it's supposed to be "reality."
 <|endoftext|> Are you a facebook user?  I check it daily. <|endoftext|> No I do not, I cannot its been around since 2004
 <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of football? I was watching and Tom Brady kinda flubbed his teams comeback at the end of the game . <|endoftext|> Yes I am.  I guess he did that since they lost last minute to the Eagles.

 <|endoftext|> I could use some sun today!  It is so cold.  Did yo know that the sun produces enough energy in one second to meet the needs of the entire Earth for a half a million years! <|endoftext|> I did not know that,  I found it intersting is the sun's dynamo process for generating energy.

I think it would be interesting to learn about Ted Kennedy. Political scandals can make great movies.
 <|endoftext|> What do you think about the Novel Literature prize being cancelled this year? <|endoftext|> I think it's pretty intense, but I support the #MeToo movement so I guess I agree with the decision to put some space between the Nobel Literature Prize and the scandals

 <|endoftext|> Do you like reading? <|endoftext|> I do like reading. What about you? Did you hear about the fact that the Nobel literature prize was canceled this year by the way?
 <|endoftext|> Hi! Are you familiar with the bible? It's crazy over 5 billion copies have been sold. I suppose that's why it's considered the best selling and most influential book of all time. <|endoftext|> Yes, I am. I believe it. I am surprised that Thomas Jefferson created his own version.
 <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy literature? <|endoftext|> I do, actually. I've wondered how people qualify for a Nobel Prize in literature, but it looks like due to a #MeToo scandal in the academy, there won't be one
 <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy literature? <|endoftext|> Some, You?

 <|endoftext|> How are you? Do you use Facebook? It's crazy they are valued at 104 billion dollars <|endoftext|> I'm great.  I actually don't use Facebook... I feel like I'm one of the few people that don't.  Even though I'm still in my 20's, I just grew tired of all the drama, political nonsense, etc. of Facebook.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|> hey there, do you use facebook? <|endoftext|> hey, yes I do have it but I rarely use it myself, what about you?
 <|endoftext|> I'm glad there had been a hotline started for street harassment happening. Too bad you can't just summons Wonder Woman, instead! <|endoftext|> Exactly!

 <|endoftext|> Hi, do you play any fantasy sports? <|endoftext|> I dont. i dont really understand them. do you play?

 <|endoftext|> Hello.  What do you think of Trump and Kim Jong Un having a signing ceremony? <|endoftext|> I'm conflicted, but I feel that the summit is simply a show and nothing substantial will come of it.

Russia is not a very nice country though, did you know that during a g20 summit they gave delegates & heads of state thumb drives & phone chargers containing trojan viruses that were 'capable of illicitly picking up computer and mobile phone data'.

 <|endoftext|> In authority regimes, a dictator or leader of one party state may also be called a president. <|endoftext|> I think that's a somewhat underhanded way to hide the fact that the government is in fact a dicatorship.

 <|endoftext|> hey how are you :) <|endoftext|> Hello!

 <|endoftext|> hey did you know that netflix makes up 33 percent of all internet bandwidht in north america? <|endoftext|> I am guilty for that bandwidth too. Netflix offered Blockbuster to work with them in 2000 and Blockbuster laughed at them.

 <|endoftext|> Netflix is really cool but also influences teenagers a lot, have you seen the serie "Everything Sucks" <|endoftext|> I have not, interesting title though. What is it about?
 <|endoftext|> Do you watch Netflix or subscribe to the service by chance?  <|endoftext|> No, I don't, but only because my internet connection wouldn't support it well.
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that Netflix scientists did a study and that there are actually more instances of sex violence and smoking that on network TV <|endoftext|> That's pretty interesting but Netflix doesn't have to worry about the FCC so I can see how it has more sex and violence
 <|endoftext|> Do you have kids or a lot of experiences watching them? <|endoftext|> I do, lots of nephews and neices.  You always have to be on guard.  Kids can get into danger very quickly
 <|endoftext|> Being a parent can be hard, now a days theres many dangers <|endoftext|> No kidding, especially if your child has a peanut allergy.  Simply inhaling peanut dust in the air can be deadly.

 <|endoftext|> What do you think about Amys brother and his using the funds of his mom for himslef <|endoftext|> I think that was a terrible thing he did.  He should be ashamed of himself.
 <|endoftext|> Do you like Orchestras ? Carlos Miguel Prieto made the conductor of the year <|endoftext|> I don't really unless it is accompanied by dance. his performance seemed like it was going to be a defeat but suddenly became delightful
 <|endoftext|> Hey there my friend! Do you like dogs by the way, we used to have a dog <|endoftext|> Yeah, they are cool but they are a lot of work so I don't have one.

 <|endoftext|> Hi there!  Are you a fan of dogs? <|endoftext|> Yeah I love dogs.
 <|endoftext|> Hi there! What kind of performance art do you enjoy for entertainment? I love going to a good concert. <|endoftext|> HI, I love a good concert.

 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> I can't believe that over a 17 year span, Tom Brady has been such a dynamic player in the NFL.
 <|endoftext|> I think top athletes like Tom Brady need to be protective of their training methods so they can keep their competitive advantage. <|endoftext|> Yes Tom Brady has shocked us all with his training
 <|endoftext|> Do you think we could use lotteries today for elections? <|endoftext|> No, I think it's fine the way it is.  I'm not sure I like the way delegates are used.  
 <|endoftext|> Do you like to watch television much? I used to watch comedy shows a lot, but I think I watch most stuff on YouTube now. How about you? <|endoftext|> Yes, I watch TV, I like the Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park the most.

 <|endoftext|> hey there, do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|> Not an enormous amount, but my teenager is a history buff, so I've been learning. Did you know the only pres to have a PhD was Woodrow Wilson?
 <|endoftext|> Hi how are you doing? The top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson <|endoftext|> That's surprising JFK was one of the wealthiest presidents, I figured there were more wealthy ex presidents than him

 <|endoftext|> Did you hear that an adult-film star was reportedly paid to stay silent about a sexual relationship with Trump before he was president? <|endoftext|> Yes. And more than just one. Apparently "about 100 women" were also "taken care of." Sounds pretty sketchy. What do you think?
 <|endoftext|> So I was reading about politics the other day, and did you know that President is actually a very common title for the head of state.  It isn't used exclusively in the US. <|endoftext|> Hello there, yeah I have heard that before.  Do you know anything interesting about any other presidents around the world?

 <|endoftext|> Good afternoon. Wouldn't it be so stressful to be the president? The head of the whole country. <|endoftext|> I think it would be. You have to appease everyone and that's the toughest job of all. 
 <|endoftext|> Hi, are you ready to chat? <|endoftext|> I am. Wondering if you know who Drake, the Canadian rapper is? Also know as Aubrey Drake Graham.
 <|endoftext|> What do you think about the case Stormy Daniels has against Trump? <|endoftext|> I don't know, but Trump says it is a total con job though. Tough to know who is truthful.

 <|endoftext|> Hello!  How you doing?  Did you know that up until 1805 the runner up in a President race would become the vice president?  Can't imagine all the fighting and jealousy THAT would have caused! <|endoftext|> I'm great how are you! Oh I'm sure I couldn't believe that either. The Vice President probably always prayed something would happen to the president haha.
 <|endoftext|> Hello, Do you enjoy using the internet? <|endoftext|> Yes, I am on the Internet all day, every day.  I just learned something new.  Did you know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button?  How cool is that?

 <|endoftext|> do you like cars? <|endoftext|> I sure do. Do you know how the drive thru came about?
 <|endoftext|> McDonald's started the drive-thru when they wanted soldiers to be able to get their food, soldiers weren't aloud out of their vehicles while wearing their fatigues! <|endoftext|> Good idea to help those who can't leave! 
 <|endoftext|> Good morning <|endoftext|> Good morning. I was schocked to know that 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. I thought it was Ford

 <|endoftext|> Hello, do you use the internet much? I know thats an obvious question considering the time and age we are on <|endoftext|> I do for sure, it's an amazing invention, definitely progressed civilization so much. It's crazy to think that it all began commercially in the early 1990s@
 <|endoftext|> I can't imagine how we used to live without the Internet.  I started using it in the 90's but before then we had nothing!    <|endoftext|> We had phones, which was virtual reality enough for some. But I get what you're saying. Today that WAS like NOTHING compared to WWW reach and its entertainment options. Right?

 <|endoftext|> Interesting how it said jfk was one of the wealthiest, I would've expected someone like FDR or Donald Trump.  <|endoftext|> Yes, I think that goes to show how little we truly know about what presidents really are like outside of the oval office.

I didn't know that about the king of Hawaii. I didn't actually know Hawaii had a king. But I did know that many people in Iceland who don't have cars travel by airplane, since there isn't a rail system. It seems kind of wasteful to me.

We've come a long way, baby as far as cars are concerned.  One of the first cars we had was the Model T.
 <|endoftext|> The science discoveries about our solar system and the universe in general is amazing. I was a young boy when sputnik was launched and now look at the knowledge we have obtained. <|endoftext|> Yes. It is amazing.

 <|endoftext|> Hello! How are you! <|endoftext|> Hi.  Pretty good considering all the drama happening in the White House.  I wonder what Trumps approval rating is.  I know Bill Clinton's approval rating went up after the affair he had with Monica.

I like to understand the science behind things myself, so I find it all so fascinating. <|endoftext|> I love cinematography and is interesting the word comes from the greek word kinema which means movement

 <|endoftext|> Have you seen pictures of Ben Affleck's back tattoo? <|endoftext|> Hello - I have seen pictures of his tattoo. It is very large and cool looking.
 <|endoftext|> Ben Affleck was mocked for his back tattoo in the movie "Gone Girl".  Surely it was not real! <|endoftext|> I think it fake as well, who knows, he doesnt talk much about his personal life, I think the interview was kind of awkward, what are your thoughts?

 <|endoftext|> Do you like shoes ? <|endoftext|> Not as much as my wife!  I am always fascinated by the new designs though.  It is amazing to think about the fact that 5000 year old shoes preform better than modern shoes.
 <|endoftext|> Hi. I really enjoy trivia facts. How about you? <|endoftext|> Hi and yes I do too.  Like, did you know that 5000 year old shoes are better than today's shoes?

 <|endoftext|> Do you have a favorite album? <|endoftext|> I used to. It was A Night at the Opera by Queen, matched only by A Day at the Races...also by Queen :) You?

 <|endoftext|> Did you know the emperor of Japan is also a scientist and still publishes papers? <|endoftext|> I did not. It is awesome that although he has such a high position, he also writes and publishes them. Scientists are fascinating. I also didn't know the world wide web was invented by a scientist either.
 <|endoftext|> Good afternoon!  Are you a fan of classical music? <|endoftext|> I am a fan, I like The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, its full with talent.
 <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy entertainment such as dramas or concerts? <|endoftext|> I do, I enjoy both, have you ever listened to the Chicago Symphony?

 <|endoftext|> So it seems the US has caused some problems internationally with their new facility in Taiwan. China isn't happy about the huge facility. <|endoftext|> Yeah, I heard that too. Ya know, Taiwan is recognized as a sovereign nation by 21 countries. But recently three have reversed that position.
 <|endoftext|> Are you a House fan? Hugh Laurie earned 700 thousand per episode. That's insane. <|endoftext|> I'm not but my parents are so I am a little familiar. That's a huge paycheck. I did not realize it had that big of an audience. 
 <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of fiction books?  <|endoftext|> Yea, my favorite fiction is short stories and novels, do you?
 <|endoftext|> It's crazy that the wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson. <|endoftext|> JFK I could see but Washington and Jefferson surprise me.  I thought Washington was just a general before becoming president.
 <|endoftext|> HI how are you? <|endoftext|> Im great, do you like fiction?
 <|endoftext|> Have you heard about Fredie Blom? <|endoftext|> I know he is 114 years old.  Seems like a nice down to earth fellow.
 <|endoftext|> do you like baseball? <|endoftext|> I love it. Do you know how the albuquerque team got its name?
 <|endoftext|> Hello, how are you.  I just saw that A 114 year old man in South Africa thinks it's finally time to quit smoking. <|endoftext|> yea.....I have also heard the same. His name is Fredie Blom
 <|endoftext|> Do you think money can make people do bad things or do you think bad people make the most money? I think there's some rap songs about this. <|endoftext|> I think that a lot of rich people are famous, so when they do bad things, it is more public.  I do not think rich people are more inclined to be bad
 <|endoftext|> Hello there, do you know much about Tesla? <|endoftext|> Hi! I know a little. Mostly because of all the press Elon Musk gets. And I've heard of Space X, a prospective project of his, I think?

 <|endoftext|> Elon Musk is quite the entrepreneur. <|endoftext|> He's best-known for Tesla, which is interestingly named after Nikola Tesla, not Elon himself
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that cars have now existed for over 150 years? <|endoftext|> Wow I didn't know that. I do know that they were created first by Karl Benz. I think he started the company Mercedes-Benz with someone else. You drive a car by the way?
 <|endoftext|> Ever drove a Tesla? <|endoftext|> No, I'd like to though.  Have you?
 <|endoftext|> Do you own a car? <|endoftext|> Hello, I do actually, do you?

 <|endoftext|> Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|> Hello! I am great. Do you like netflix?
 <|endoftext|> hey there, did you know that bruce lee was a great dancer? he was a chacha championship winner in 1958 <|endoftext|> No, I had no idea, but he was good on his feet so I can see how he was a great dancer

 <|endoftext|> Do you remember the Micheal Brown shooting in Ferguson Mo?  It was so heartbreaking. The Prosecuter Rober McCulloch said that he was impartial. <|endoftext|> I remember too well, very very sad. And since the grand jury decided to not indict Darren Wilson for his murdering Michael Brown it caused so many protests, I don't think it was right. There was so much media about it on Facebook it was crazy!
 <|endoftext|> Hello. Are you a fan of Facebook? Seems like it's been around forever but it actually launched in 2004. <|endoftext|> Yes I remember when you had to have a college email to register to use Facebook!
 <|endoftext|> I think elections are important to change leaders. <|endoftext|> I do too when they are real elections. I don't believe we have had one of those for quite some time. Just my opinion. 
 <|endoftext|> Hey there what do you think about the White House? Do you know that the White House is twin buildings in other countries as well? <|endoftext|> I figure that Ireland and France like all things American. They wish they were America, with our White House and such.
 <|endoftext|> hi, do you watch tv? <|endoftext|> How are you? I love to watch movies, sometimes TV. How about you?
 <|endoftext|> hi, do you eatch tv? <|endoftext|> Yes, I watch TV but it's more YouTube than traditional TV. I guess I do miss out on some things like free comedy films.

 <|endoftext|> Hi there, do you know much about the Presidents? <|endoftext|> I know some things. I know that I would liked to have gone to an Obama era state dinner. They sounded like amazing parties!

 <|endoftext|> Hello,  did you know the president's guest house is bigger than the white house? <|endoftext|> Nope. Have you by any chance ever toured the White House?
 <|endoftext|> Kristen Bell's TV show "The Good Place" sounds interesting. I haven't seen it, but I have heard it is very funny. <|endoftext|> Ive seen the first season,  it is great!  very funny! 
 <|endoftext|> hey there, do you like TV? <|endoftext|> I like some tv.  Even though I hate to admit it, South  Park is one of my favorite shows.
 <|endoftext|> How do you think our president is doing? <|endoftext|> I don't really pay attention to politics. But it's not the first time a president has been elected while losing the popular vote. Five presidents have been elected in this way, with the greatest margin being ten percent.
 <|endoftext|> Hey there do you play any instruments like the guitar or piano? <|endoftext|> I like to play the guitar, what about you?
 <|endoftext|> Hi. How do you feel about the rise of threats against public  figures on social media? <|endoftext|> I feel bad about it, there are many wackos in social media
 <|endoftext|> Howdy friend! Ever hear of Eric Garcetti? <|endoftext|> Hello there, no I have never heard of him.  Do you know who he is?
 <|endoftext|> The president sure has an important job <|endoftext|> Yes, I would not want to make all the decisions a president has to make every day.  I would be constantly second guessing myself.
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> Good.  So, what do you think about presidents with beards always being republican?
 <|endoftext|> Do you really believe Kim Jong-un was voted sexiest man? <|endoftext|> That is hard to believe but it was The Onion so I'm sure it was done facetiously. I think it's even sadder that China actually believes it to be true. 
 <|endoftext|> hi do you watch much tv? <|endoftext|> I sure do. Do you ever watch the SImpsons?
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> Good, I am reading fun facts about TV. Do you know how many pokemon there are?

 <|endoftext|> Good morning. Do you like watching YouTube videos? I was just surprised to find it was the second largest search engine on the net. <|endoftext|> YouTube was purchased by google, so I guess they share search engine technology. I do like YouTube.
 <|endoftext|> do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|> SOme stuff. Do you know who the three wealthiest ones are?
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? What do you think of the president? <|endoftext|> But I think he says a lot of interesting things. I was shocked to learn that he's not one of the top three richest presidents though
 <|endoftext|> do you know much about the president? <|endoftext|> Yes I know that Wilson was the only one to have a PhD
 <|endoftext|> I suspect the information about the richest presidents is out of date now. I don't think any of the three listed would have qualified as billionaires in today's terms. <|endoftext|> I dont know how they adjust the value of the land that washington and jefferson owned. was it rich for their time?
 <|endoftext|> Do you follow the government much? <|endoftext|> I try to know only what is necessary.  It is crazy sometimes.
 <|endoftext|> Hi, do you follow politics? <|endoftext|> Yes I do. It is important to know about the politics going on. Especially in the senate since it is considered the more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives.
 <|endoftext|> Do you like to dance.  <|endoftext|> I do but I am not coordinated so no one likes to dance with me.
 <|endoftext|> Hello - how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Great. Hope you're well! So are you a fan of dancing? Bruce Lee happened to be an outstanding dancer and even won the Cha-Cha championship in Hong Kong back in 1958.

 <|endoftext|> hey did you know that Babe Ruth was also a famous golfer?  <|endoftext|> I didnt, so not only a baseball hall of famer but also a famous golfer, I guess he had sports running through his veins
 <|endoftext|> I was reading an article and it stated that our White House has twin buildings in Ireland and France. I thought that was interesting <|endoftext|> I think so too! I never really thought the white house would be replicated anywhere else. I wonder why the white house still uses floppy disks to store files?
 <|endoftext|> Do you ever play golf?  It can be a fun, but very challenging sport. <|endoftext|> Yes, I do, but not very often. The cost of playing is prohibitive for me. I don't have a private golf course like Trump, nor am I a millionaire like many of our former presidents.
 <|endoftext|> do you know much about the president? <|endoftext|> Yes I do. Do you know who the three wealthiest ones are?
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that the President is the head of government? <|endoftext|> That is true in most republics.  It certainly is in the US.

 <|endoftext|> Hey how's it going. I think animals are so fascinating and I love learning about them. Did you know there are about 20 quintillion individual animals on planet earth? <|endoftext|> That is how many zeroes ? Does it count insects ?
 <|endoftext|> Rent many cars? You got to be careful with deals that seem too good. Stay away from non-refundable rates. <|endoftext|> I have not had the need to rent many cars myself but I feel like I learned a lot of tips from this article
 <|endoftext|> hi, do you like cars? <|endoftext|> I do, i just bought a new one in September.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|> Hey! Trump has been having a tough go lately. Especially back when implemented a zero crackdown on immigrant families. <|endoftext|> Yeah, more and more Republican are against him, do you think he will change his policy ? 
 <|endoftext|> Have you heard of Chelsea Hodson before? <|endoftext|> No, haven't heard of her who is Chelsea Hodson?
 <|endoftext|> Have you ever rented a car before? <|endoftext|> Yes I am over 26 so I can actually Rent A Car, what about you? I don't like Avis charging cancellation fees, $150 is way too much
 <|endoftext|> I sure do. Do you know who Reggie Miller is? <|endoftext|> Yes I love the guy he is so good but did you know his sister is even better?

 <|endoftext|> Wow...did you know why McDonald's initially added drive thru's to their restaurants?  <|endoftext|> I heard soldiers could not get out in their fatigues, good response by them. REading this, I kinda wish my trunk was still actually a wooden trunk.
 <|endoftext|> Good morning!  It's a snowy day here and I was thinking of spending some time with a movie.  Do you like dramas? <|endoftext|> I'm more of a comedy person myself, but I understand that drama is traditionally the middle ground between comedy and tragedy.  
 <|endoftext|> Hello, how are you? Do you like cars? <|endoftext|> Yes I do like cars. It's crazy that the first car was invented in the late 1800s that seems so long ago
 <|endoftext|> Unfortunately, at the Youth Peace Center in Chicago a person spoke of being shot six times in the back of the head. "It was like Iraq", the person said, but he hasn't been in Iraq. <|endoftext|> What a sad day. Also the day of the Parkland, FL shooting. WHat is wrong with people these days?
 <|endoftext|> Have you heard of the Chicago massacre? People compared it to war. Chicago has a high murder rate. <|endoftext|> Yes it's a shame.I think that the tearing down of the high rise public housing caused the diffusion of gang problems into other neighborhoods.
 <|endoftext|> How's it going, did you know Karl Benz was the first person to patent the car? <|endoftext|> I didn't.  It makes sense... Did you know that McDonald's developed drive-thus to help soldiers?  I helped me too.
 <|endoftext|> Hi.  I don't know what I'd do without a telephone.  Did you know an iPhone has more computing power that the entire U.S. nuclear deterrent?  Wow. <|endoftext|> Yes, that says a lot about both things doesn't it?  I agree, my phone is my lifeline as well.  It's funny how vulnerable they seem to be.  The cables carrying phone and Internet data across oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor.
 <|endoftext|> hey what are your thoughts on Pink Floyd? <|endoftext|> pretty cool, as cool as to play a concerts in an ancient amphitheatre without an audience?

 <|endoftext|> Hi. Wouldn't it be funny to be watching a soccer match and have a dog on the field save a play? <|endoftext|> I heard that happened at a soccer game in Juventud Unida de Gualeguaychù. But where was the goalie?
 <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy walking dogs? <|endoftext|> Dogs are my favorite pet so I guess I do, what about you?
 <|endoftext|> Discussion of work boots reminded me I really need to get some new work boots soon -- my current pair is getting really worn. <|endoftext|> I need me some boots. My dog ate mine!

 <|endoftext|> Headlines are really important they can influence a hole article. <|endoftext|> Yes, they can. Just like in the case of Dennis Kucinich. What about those headlines?
 <|endoftext|> The president has an important job and also is a really powerfull person <|endoftext|> Hi did you know that first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana? lol
 <|endoftext|> Hello! Are you interested a lot in politics? <|endoftext|> I sometimes follow politics. How about you?
 <|endoftext|> The president is a common title for the head of state or government. <|endoftext|> Good morning! Yes, it seems to be a universal term. Even in Zimbabwe although they referred to their first president as President Banana. 
 <|endoftext|> did You know that the top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson ? <|endoftext|> I didn't realize that! I heard that women were not allowed to wear pants in the Senate until 1993!

 <|endoftext|> hi, do you watch baseball? <|endoftext|> It's hard for me to sit and watch it because I would rather play the game. Even the coaches are dressed in uniforms in case the need arises for them to play for their teams
 <|endoftext|> I never knew that the reason a baseball manager wore a uniform was so that he could play if needed. Did you? <|endoftext|> I did not know that at all thats a cool thing to learn
 <|endoftext|> Hi.  Do you use facebook?  Did you know that it was launched back in 2004? <|endoftext|> Hi, I remember it launching. Myspace at the time was so much better. They actually had the chance to buy facebook in 2005 for just 75 million but turned it down. oops.
 <|endoftext|> do you use facebook much? <|endoftext|> All the timer. Do you know why it is blue?
 <|endoftext|> What are your thoughts on Trump?  <|endoftext|> Pretty unfavorable. Unfavorable of the whole republican party, actually. You?
 <|endoftext|> Hey there! Have you heard of the disturbing scandal involving the  Minnesota legislator and his daughter?  <|endoftext|> If it's that disturbing he should probably face criminal charges.  
 <|endoftext|> What do you think about Trump's economic advisor? <|endoftext|> Hello, I think he is pretty good. What do you think? I also like Trump though.
 <|endoftext|> Hello, have you ever been to the white house? <|endoftext|> no i have not been to the white house. id love to go some day. You?
 <|endoftext|> hey my friend can you guess the 3 wealthiest presidents? <|endoftext|> Hmmm... let's see? Was it JFK, Roosevelt and Trump?

 <|endoftext|> How's it going, did you know every president since John Adams has lived in the White House? <|endoftext|> No I didn't know that. I also didn't know that the White House has twin buildings around the world, one is in France and another is in Ireland
 <|endoftext|> I would like to visit the White House some day, so many history in one place. <|endoftext|> It is a wonderful place. But the president there now is making false statement.
 <|endoftext|> Good morning!  Do you use facebook?  Can you believe it was launched back in 2004? <|endoftext|> Yes I do! It is very hard to believe wow. I remember when I first got mine. Don't use it so much anymore. Hard to believe a third of all divorce filings in the USA in 2011 contained the word "facebook"
 <|endoftext|> Did you hear what happened with the legislator from Minnesota? <|endoftext|> I hadn't until today. Allegations like that can sure change your career path. Not surprised no charges were filed though.
 <|endoftext|> Hello - how are you today?  <|endoftext|> I'm doing pretty good, how about yourself?
 <|endoftext|> Hi there, do you follow politics? <|endoftext|> Not much, do you? I get so tired of hearing about Republicans and Democrats fighting.
 <|endoftext|> I love Elton John. Are you a fan? <|endoftext|> Yea, I enjoy it when it is on. I don't seek it however. I hear Donald Trump also loves Elton John.

 <|endoftext|> Hey there, do you follow politics much? <|endoftext|> Yes, mainly the President and actions taken by Congress.  Lately, I was surprised to know that Trump wasn't one of the top 3 richest presidents. 
 <|endoftext|> It's crazy to think that the top three richest presidents were JFK, Washington and Thomas Jefferson.  <|endoftext|> Yeah, I agree.  They must have factored inflation into that
 <|endoftext|> Hey there what are your thoughts on Elton John? <|endoftext|> Elton John? Is that guy still alive? I thought that he died or something.

 <|endoftext|> Do you like golf? <|endoftext|> Phil and Tiger are my favorite players.

 <|endoftext|> Do you want to improve your finances?  <|endoftext|> I do! Do you?
 <|endoftext|> Hello! What do you do for entertainment? <|endoftext|> Hi!  I like to watch a lot television and play golf.  I wish I thought of the idea for YouTube.  It sold for 1.65 billion in 2006, cannot even imagine what it is worth today!!
 <|endoftext|> How's it going, do you watch youtube? It was created in 2005 <|endoftext|> I do, Google owns the company right?
 <|endoftext|> I know the article is good but "home buyers who focus on their personal finances are going to be the winners, because they will have the means to make fast, substantial offers"... no duh! <|endoftext|> I know, right? We also know that mortgage lenders have strict guidelines before lending people money to buy a house.
 <|endoftext|> I absolutely love star wars! What about you? <|endoftext|> I do as well! It is a world wide pop culture phenomenon
 <|endoftext|> Hi. Do you like Star Wars? A new Hope released back in 1977 is a real classic in my opinion. <|endoftext|> More of a fan when I was a kid, watch the new ones with my son now.

 <|endoftext|> Do you watch "Modern Family"?  They killed off a main character.  In the interest of a "spoiler alert" I'll not tell unless asked. <|endoftext|> I have seen it. I am glad it wasn't Stella the dog.
 <|endoftext|> hey do you ever wear costumes? like for instance during halloweeN? <|endoftext|> I'm not really a costume person. How about you?
 <|endoftext|> Hello <|endoftext|> Good morning!  Hope you are doing well today

 <|endoftext|> Hey! Do you play Nintendo at all? Hard to believe they just discontinued the original NES in Japan in 2003. I still remember getting mine in 1985! <|endoftext|> I loved the original Nintendo. I can't believe Japan produced them that long. That's surprising. Did you also know that for a documentary a company will be excavating the famous atari game landfill?

 <|endoftext|> Its a good thing we live in a democracy, we have a president and not a dictator or authoritarian regime <|endoftext|> I feel like the line is getting a little blurry currently though, a lot of changes are going unseen.
 <|endoftext|> Hey there what do you think about Kanye West? <|endoftext|> I think Kanye needs to see a mental health professional, as those around him are not giving him the help he needs. That "dragon energy" bit was bizarre, but he was on to something with that hydrogen power that everyone glossed over.
 <|endoftext|> Hi there! How are you doing this fine Internet evening? <|endoftext|> Hi! I'm just catching up on some reading and saw that Chance the Rapper received backlash for sharing his opinion about not needing to support Democrats. I think that's a little sad that being a public figure, you can't express your opinions without backlash.
 <|endoftext|> Hi are you a fan of rap? <|endoftext|> No, not really. I don't know it. I prefer melody and harmony. You?
 <|endoftext|> do you like rap music? <|endoftext|> I like some of it and you?

 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> Good, did you know that only one of Kayne's top 10 songs is in a minor key?

 <|endoftext|> Are you a fan of rap? <|endoftext|> I do listen to rap on occasion. How about you, do you like rap?
 <|endoftext|> Kanye West sure has a lot of credentials as a rapper, singer, songwriter and more. <|endoftext|> Yes he does, I at first did not really care for Kanye West, but now I do like him. Do you like him or no?
 <|endoftext|> hey there, do you like music? <|endoftext|> I do, but I am not a big fan of rap.  Some rappers like Kanye West are pretty out there.

 <|endoftext|> Hi!  Are you a fan of Kanye West? <|endoftext|> I honestly don't know that much about him. Rap isn't really my kind of music but he seems like a fascinating person.

 <|endoftext|> do you watch tv? <|endoftext|> a lot. do you watch the simpsons?

 <|endoftext|> Interesting that the 70's show was remade verbatim in the UK.  <|endoftext|> Yeah,  but I didnt know England even had the 1970s... I guess that is why it was canceled after only 10 episodes.
 <|endoftext|> Do you still have cable tv or did you cut the cord? <|endoftext|> I rent a house with my brother, I mooch off his cable
 <|endoftext|> Do you know the founding story behind Netflix? One of the guys ran up a late fee, and was so disgusted that he started netflix! <|endoftext|> No, I didn't know that!  Funny that Blockbuster could have bought Netflix and didn't 
 <|endoftext|> It was fascinating how they tied all of those diverse topics together, Disinformation, Smoking, Google <|endoftext|> Do you  think the US anti-smoking campaign does fight disinformation?
 <|endoftext|> Hello, what are your thoughts on the US senate? <|endoftext|> Hey. I think they have a very important job being the upper chamber of the US Congress.
 <|endoftext|> Do you follow the US Senate at all? <|endoftext|> I did the Kavanaugh stuff. Did you?
 <|endoftext|> Hello, did you know that Kristjen Nielsen is the US Homeland Security Secretary.   <|endoftext|> I was aware of that yes. She has held a lot of press briefings. 
 <|endoftext|> Hello, how are you this evening? <|endoftext|> Very well, thank you. I hope you are as well?  Not doing your laundry in the famous geyser, Old Faithful, as was the ritual in the old days?
 <|endoftext|> Did you hear that the Norwegian government donated money to save the Amazon rainforest? I guess they've got cash to spare in Norway. <|endoftext|> Must be nice! Do you smoke?

 <|endoftext|> Hi do you follow football? <|endoftext|> Good afternoon, yes, i do a little.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|> Hi.  I guess for those people missing NFL games they can do fantasy.  I know my grandson is really into it.  He's a huge Andrew Luck fan and hopes to ride him to a good season. <|endoftext|> i have never tried fantasy sports. how does it work? do you bet or something?
 <|endoftext|> Aretha Franklin's passing was quite a big deal from history, art, society, music on a lot of levels. <|endoftext|> She was amazing. I heard her funeral was quite a production. She was carried in the same white cadillac that carried Rosa Parks and her father Rev. CL Franklin
 <|endoftext|> Good morning, do you like football? <|endoftext|> Yea, I love the nfl which is known as Gridiron football around the world, do you?
 <|endoftext|> hey there, are you a fan of concerts? <|endoftext|> Yes.  I love concerts.  I am always reading reviews about concerts.  Did you know that in 2002, a Creed concert was so bad that people walked out and sued the band.
 <|endoftext|> Are you a football fan? American style. <|endoftext|> I enjoy fantasy football, particularly in week 8.
 <|endoftext|> I have grown up in an era when Arethra Franklin has not been active as an entertainer. I did not expect so many famous people to attend her funeral. <|endoftext|> She was admired by many who came from different backgrounds
 <|endoftext|> How's it going? Have you heard about the two nooses found at the Mississippi State Capitol? How appalling <|endoftext|> Hello! Yes I have heard it, it's terrible. I think it's indicative of a larger problem. Trump was going to speak for Cindy Hyde-Smith that same day I believe, and she made a joke recently about a "public hanging", it's absurd.
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm great! Do you listen to the radio?
 <|endoftext|> Hello.  Anybody there?  I am trapped in the US Senate chamber and I can't get out! <|endoftext|> Ok, it might be awhile, you know how slow they are to move in Washington. Lol
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that every US president with a beard has been a republican?  <|endoftext|> Must be something in their philosophy.  Hopefully if they have a female candidate one day it not a requirement.
 <|endoftext|> Hi, did you know the US Senate used the same gavel for 165 years until Nixon broke it!  Sign of things to come... <|endoftext|> I didn't know this. Who is the presiding officer of the Senate?
 <|endoftext|> Do you follow US politics? <|endoftext|> Yes I think it's important to stay up-to-date. The Republican Party currently controls the presidency. Or should I say the Grand Old Party!
 <|endoftext|> Hello - did you know the top 3 wealthiest presidents in US history were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson? <|endoftext|> I've heard that. It's hard to believe that Trump isn't even in the top. 
 <|endoftext|> Good morning! Do you like politics? <|endoftext|> Hi, tricky question.  I like following political news but talking it can sometimes be difficult.
 <|endoftext|> Do you think it is OK for the opposing party to criticize past presidents? <|endoftext|> I am not sure, I think instead of bringing people down by bringing up negative stuff about other people,  that people should just say positive things about themselves. 
 <|endoftext|> hey there, do you know much about us politics? <|endoftext|> somewhat, lets talk about the senate. they used the same gavel for 165 years until nixon cracked it
 <|endoftext|> How are you? Did you know the Republican party was founded in 1854? <|endoftext|> Never knew that! It was founded by anti-slavery activists, economic modernizers, ex-National Republicans, ex-Free Soilers and Whigs. It seems to have changed though. 
 <|endoftext|> Did you know the Republican Party is also referred to as the GOP (Grand Old Party)? <|endoftext|> I've heard that. It's crazy to think that there hasn't been a president who wasn't democrat or republican since 1853. Maybe time for more than two parties?
 <|endoftext|> Have you heard of the idiots who hung nooses outside the Capitol building in Mississippi? <|endoftext|> I did, that was absolutely awful, I don't think they have found them yet.

 <|endoftext|> The Virginia House trying to expand medicare using Trump and Pence is an odd occurance <|endoftext|> I agree. House Speaker M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) contends that expanding the federal-state health-care program during the Trump administration offers the "best chance for conservative reforms."
 <|endoftext|> Are you familiar with the US elected positions like the senate or president? <|endoftext|> Yes.  I know the U.S. senate just had  a runoff featuring a black democrat.
 <|endoftext|> Hello there, do you know much about politics in general? <|endoftext|> Yes I follow it a lot.  It is awful what Republican leaders are doing.  They will not stand up to Trump at all.
 <|endoftext|> did you know that Trump wouldn't be in the top 3 wealthiest presidents? Like that must be adjusted for inflation <|endoftext|> I did not. That would be an interesting thing to look into. Speaking of presidents, did you know that the first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana?
 <|endoftext|> Hey there. The President is something else, huh. He sure travels all over too. <|endoftext|> yes he is always on news 
 <|endoftext|> Do you follow politics much? Every once in a while I'll see an article that catches my eye <|endoftext|> Yeah from time to time. Do you know much about the Senate in the US?

 <|endoftext|> Hi there. Telephones are great, but we can talk using our computers too. <|endoftext|> Yep, I last used a landline about 13 years ago. Crazy to think the cablese that carry phone traffic are only about 3 inches wide and just lay on the ocean floor.

 <|endoftext|> hi, do you like horses? <|endoftext|> Hello - yes, I think they are very cool creatures. What about you?
 <|endoftext|> Do you listen to classical music at all? I think it is kind of funny that a shopping center in australia play it in order to stop teens from loitering.

 <|endoftext|> The White House is a place with a lot of history dont you think? <|endoftext|> Hello there, yeah it sure does, since 1801 I think. 
 <|endoftext|> The president sure does an important job <|endoftext|> Some might say he does a bad job at an important job lol. It's too bad there's not a backup to balance out his worse impulses; until 1805, the runner-up in the election became VP. One can only wonder how Hillary Clinton would influence decisions with her perspective.

 <|endoftext|> Did you know the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office?  <|endoftext|> Did he really? That's kind of funny!

 <|endoftext|> Do you like basketball much? <|endoftext|> It's not one of my most favorite sports because I'm a little on the short side so I was never very good at it! How about you?

 <|endoftext|> How's it going? Did you know the size of the entire Universe is till unknown? <|endoftext|> I think I did know that! The universe is so crazy. There are people who believe that the universe is actually virtual reality. Did you know that (though it's impossible) if you folded paper 103 times, it would be as thick as the universe that we can observe?
 <|endoftext|> Hello. What do you think of the universe? <|endoftext|> Well, I think it's vast and that our human minds can't even begin to comprehend it.
 <|endoftext|> Hey there!  Are you a basketball fan?  I am Bulls fan and we stink!  We are probably as good as the Lakers though which is funny since they had such high expectations. <|endoftext|> I'm a little bit of a fan. I watch some of the Spurs games.  Have you heard of Tim Duncan?

 <|endoftext|> Hello, do you follow politics? <|endoftext|> I do. Do you?
 <|endoftext|> The republican party is full with controversy <|endoftext|> Is that right?  Why do you say that?

 <|endoftext|> Hello my name is MIsty how are you? <|endoftext|> Hi. The last us president to speak a foreign language fluently was fdr.
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> It's interesting how Trump has such loyal supporters that they would wait in a lawn chair before an event where he will be attending.
 <|endoftext|> I think our government is failing us and it's primarily the President's fault. <|endoftext|> I do not believe that. I believe that the media is making it look that way.

 <|endoftext|> Hey! Are you interested in politics? <|endoftext|> I do follow a bit, right now everything political is so tense, especially with Trumps comments.
 <|endoftext|> Can you believe the first president of Zimbabwe was called "President Banana"? That's pretty crazy  <|endoftext|> hahaha thats wierd.  1988 a chimpanzee received 400.000 votes in a mayoral election in rio de janeiro, coming in third place.
 <|endoftext|> Good Morning! Have you been to any concerts lately? <|endoftext|> No, in fact I don't quite remember my last concert. Like the Ramone who probably don't remember their first concerts, they have been touring for 20 years.

 <|endoftext|> Hello, do you want to chat about the President, Voting, or the Republicans?   <|endoftext|> Hey how is it going, I'm down for whatever. Voting is pretty patriotic though, unlike the President.

 <|endoftext|> Did you know the president of Indoensia has released 3 pop albums while in office?  <|endoftext|> That is pretty wild, it would be like Trump doing more Celebrity Apprentice shows.

 <|endoftext|> Did you ever go to college? What are the skills that you think we're the most necessary to your success <|endoftext|> I did.  What you learn in college is very different from what you need for real life success.  Like how to buy a house, insurance, medical stuff...

 <|endoftext|> Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|> I am doing well, yourself?
 <|endoftext|> Hello,  how are you doing?  Do you like football? The university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink <|endoftext|> I guess the pink is meant to soften up the opposition. The game of football certainly has a lot of interesting history.

 <|endoftext|> Hello, do you pay particular attention to politics? <|endoftext|> I try to, but it seems to be such a hostile subject nowadays.  People seem to not be able to converse without either name calling, or just being nasty.

 <|endoftext|> Hello did you know Asian nations are likely to welcome warmer relations. <|endoftext|> I did not know that.  It would seem that Japan and China are not on good terms since 2010 when the Chinese trawler rammed a Japanese Coast Guard ship.

 <|endoftext|> How horrifying to go through a trauma like a school shooting only to be then inundated with claims that you are a crisis actor. <|endoftext|> I couldn't even imagine going through something so horrific and seeing my friends die. School shootings seem way too common of a thing nowadays; so sad.

 <|endoftext|> One thing you can say about Trump: He is no robot! Am I right? <|endoftext|> Did you know robots can be controlled by rat brains? That must be a fun experiment.
 <|endoftext|> Hi do you listen to the radio still? <|endoftext|> Hello, I actually do. I'm close enough to the border of Canada, and was surprised to find out that Canadian law requires 40% of all music played to be Canadian. Are there even that many Canadian artists?
 <|endoftext|> How's it going, do you listen to radio much? It's quite complicated how electromagnetic energy waves are transmitted into sound <|endoftext|> Yes. I listen often. Yes its complicated. I never think of that. I guess  i take radio for granted.

 <|endoftext|> Hello, do you like to watch TV? <|endoftext|> I do. What do you like to watch?
 <|endoftext|> Are you familiar with Kellyanne Conway? <|endoftext|> I've seen her on the news, and heard her speak a bit.  She seems to be a pseudo-communications lead for the current White House.  It's got to be a tough job.
 <|endoftext|> I have learned that a CNN person thinks that Kellyanne Conway is wrong when she says, "No evidence of collusion"  Big surprise that a CNN person would assert that! <|endoftext|> Well, I was hoping not to enter into politics, but , I think Kellyane Conway is a politic figure. 
 <|endoftext|> The president is the function head of the government and the council of ministers. His main duty to protect the people and bring welfare scheme to the improvement of people living in the nation. <|endoftext|> Good morning, I suppose President have differing amounts of power in different nation.
 <|endoftext|> Well, I guess there is more in the news about President Trump, Kellyanne Conway, and Fox News itself, again. Have you heard? <|endoftext|> Yeah.  Did you know fox news threatened to sue the simpsons in order to stop them from parodying the anit democratic agenda?
 <|endoftext|> Although I can't agree with someone like Jordan Peterson, I can agree that he can be thought provoking in a sense! <|endoftext|> I do agree that our many computer screens can distract us from the people directly in front of us
 <|endoftext|> Do you like to watch the NFL? <|endoftext|> Good Morning!  I do enjoy a good football game, but baseball is my favorite sport.
 <|endoftext|> Hello. Beautiful morning, The sun is shing bright. I recently found out the sun is actually white. Interesting <|endoftext|> That is interesting.  Did you know the sun produces enough energy in a second to power the planet for years?

 <|endoftext|> hey there do you ever watch the NFL? I used to watch them a lot, not much anymore though <|endoftext|> Times have changed, people are more sensible to commotions, I think putting chips to monitor the player won't solve the issue. 
 <|endoftext|> Hello.  Do you watch any nfl games? <|endoftext|> I do! Which of the 32 teams is your favorite to root for?
 <|endoftext|> Good morning! How are you today? I'm just hanging out for the day. Do you like sports? <|endoftext|> Hi, I'm fine.

 <|endoftext|> You an NFL fan? I am mad the season is over. It was a fun exciting season, I watched 16 games this season! <|endoftext|> Not a fan at all, really. And I'm still waiting for the Redskins to change their controversial, outdated, and offensive name :/

 <|endoftext|> I love going to concerts.  SOmething about a live performance is so much better than listening to a track on your headphones. <|endoftext|> I used to love going to them, now not so much. I remember going to Linkin Park concert in 2001 after Hybrid Theory came out and it was great. They played like 324 concerts just in that year.
 <|endoftext|> Do you watch baseball ever? <|endoftext|> Usually during the playoffs and World Series. I do like going to games though in person. I heard Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling was invited to join his teammates at a reunion event at Fenway.

 <|endoftext|> Hello, do you like football? <|endoftext|> I do not know much about football. I think I know more about baseball. Like the Chicago Cubs were the first team to win back to back world series and did not win again.
 <|endoftext|> Hey how's it going? Do you have any pets? I really want to get a dog. They were the first animal species to be domesticated! <|endoftext|> I have a feral cat that I feed but I would love to get a dog as well. Domestic animals like dogs were the first species of selectively bred animals. Behaviors, physical attributes and sensory capabilities can all be bred into certain dogs that have a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. All very interesting, indeed. 
 <|endoftext|> hi how are you? Do you like baseball? <|endoftext|> Hello and I think it might be unamerican not to  lol 
 <|endoftext|> Hi. Do you like baseball? <|endoftext|> I don't know a whole lot about it, I usually watch mostly during world series time.

 <|endoftext|> Hey! you still buy albums at all? I think they are outdated now. Just like the audio cassette and the vinyl phased out in the 2000's! <|endoftext|> Yes, the old eight track is not around anymore either. LOL
 <|endoftext|> Hello there, do you follow baseball at all? <|endoftext|> Hello. Not really. My kids do, their favorite team is the Cubs. I didn't know they were called the Orphans.
 <|endoftext|> Good Morning! How are you today? <|endoftext|> I am doing well. Just watching a little Tv, or telly as some call it.
 <|endoftext|> Hi! Did you feel Boston was right in not inviting Schilling to join the 2004 team at Fenway? I'm a little torn but I agree he what he said about the pipe bomb terrorist was disturbing so I don't blame Boston there! <|endoftext|> No, I don't either. With all these terrorist. I didn't know baseball managers can play for their teams!
 <|endoftext|> do you enjoy listening to albums? <|endoftext|> Yes i do. Have you listened to Hybrid Theory?
 <|endoftext|> Hello. Do you own a domestic dog?  <|endoftext|> Yes her name is Dodo and she likes to run, hop, and play. You?
 <|endoftext|> How many teams are in the National Football League? <|endoftext|> 32 teams. They are divided into the NFC and the AFC. Did you know that they have a 17 week season. I wish it was 20.
 <|endoftext|> Hello! Do you like dogs/ <|endoftext|> I love dogs..my dog is next to me now
 <|endoftext|> Hello! How are you tonight? <|endoftext|> Hi, I am well. How about you?
 <|endoftext|> Do you like trousers ? <|endoftext|> haha well I do, I call them pants though, what about you?
 <|endoftext|> Hi, did you know the Zimbabwe's president was called president banana? <|endoftext|> I do not think I would want to be a president known as president banana!
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that the government owns like 85% of Nevada?? <|endoftext|> wow that is crazy, the government is weird I guess a rich billionaire bailed them out back in 1895
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> I am good but I struggle with the state of our democracy and unwillingness to talk to each other.
 <|endoftext|> Hello did you know that every president with a bread has been a republican? <|endoftext|> Oh, yeah, so there's never been a bearded democrat ? I am surprised about that beards were very popular in 1800s. 
 <|endoftext|> I stayed up so late watching TV last night. There are so many things to watch these days. Did you know there are over 750 episodes of Pokemon?! <|endoftext|> Yes my queue list is huge.  There are so many shows to watch.  I love watching the Simpsons.  Did you know there is only one episode  where Bart doesn't appear or is mentioned?
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? Do you use Facebook? <|endoftext|> Hi! Yes, I do, but concern about privacy. It's quite hot topic about Facebook. Are you FB user?
 <|endoftext|> Hello!  It's a rare sunny day here it seems.  Amazing what a little sun can do and how reliant we are for it. <|endoftext|> It is not here!  Cold and miserable!  I can't believe that the Parkland shooter is getting fan mail
 <|endoftext|> hey there, do you know much about politics? <|endoftext|> I think I do.
 <|endoftext|> Hello, do you watch tv? <|endoftext|> Hi yes I watch some TV. Do you use Netflix?
 <|endoftext|> hey there, do you follow celebrities much? <|endoftext|> I don't actively follow celebrities, but I do find some of them interesting when they pop up in the news in general. I find the notion of celebrity chefs to be kind of ridiculous, though.
 <|endoftext|> Good Morning! How are you today? <|endoftext|> Great, what about yourself? do you subscribe to Netflix?
 <|endoftext|> I use Netflix a lot. Do you use Netflix? <|endoftext|> I do, too. They have 137 million subscribers!
 <|endoftext|> Hello there, do you attend many concerts? <|endoftext|> Getting older and have a family now, so not as many as I used to.
 <|endoftext|> surprised espn won an emmy <|endoftext|> ESPN has been around for a while. Why are you surprised? Do you think their content is bad?
 <|endoftext|> Hello. I always like learning more about how things came to be. For example pilgrims clothing was colorful and they wore black for special occasions. <|endoftext|> That's interesting, I heard Greeks made asbestos clothing.
 <|endoftext|> I find it neat that football is regional.  Some people think soccer, some people thing rugby.  But the game is still a ball and a opposing team. <|endoftext|> Cool, do you watch alot of sports?
 <|endoftext|> Hey how's it going? Do you enjoy football? I think it's cool that there's so many variations like Canadian or Australian rules or rugby. <|endoftext|> I'm a woman so I don't play football or soccer but I love to go to live games to see all the action.  Did you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team?  Is that cool or what?
 <|endoftext|> Hi, Are you having a good day? <|endoftext|> hey, im having a really good day what about you?
 <|endoftext|> hi how are you? <|endoftext|> doing good. How bout you.
 <|endoftext|> Good morning! Do you enjoy concerts? I love performances and love seeing things live! <|endoftext|> Hello, I love concerts. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in just 2001?
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that Wikileaks published the Government's plans to destroy Wikileaks? I'm guessing that plan didn't pan out so well.  <|endoftext|> I was thinking the same thing! It definitely did not work out. I think it is cool that the Norwegian govt. donated $1billion to help save the amazon rainforest.
 <|endoftext|> It looks like the wealthiest presidents in American history JFK, Washington and Jefferson! <|endoftext|> That's surprising! But not as surprising as facts about Indonesia's president - did you know that they have released 3 pop albums, while in office?
 <|endoftext|> Hi there, are you a fan of football at all? <|endoftext|> Yes big time! Did you happen to catch the superbowl?
 <|endoftext|> Hello,How are you? Do you like to go to concerts? <|endoftext|> Yes, I've gone to lots and lots of concerts but none lately. How about you, any current concerts that you went to?
 <|endoftext|> JFK was among the walthiest presidents of all time. <|endoftext|> So  have read.  But it is hard to believe that Washington and Jefferson were also. I guess adjusted for  inflation.
 <|endoftext|> do you know that steven spielberg played the clainet for the soundtrack in Jaws haha? <|endoftext|> No, I didn't know that. I didn't even think he was musical.
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that the first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana? What do you suppose that was about? <|endoftext|> Maybe it was a nickname. Hopefully it is seen a respectful one and not like some of the names that people have called our past presidents. 
 <|endoftext|> What's your favorite music from a movie, book, or TV? <|endoftext|> The soundtrack to JAWS.  Did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in it. Funny, funny stuff.
 <|endoftext|> How's it going do you watch football? Gridiron, not rugby <|endoftext|> Yes I like American football
 <|endoftext|> did you know that Pilgrims actually wore a lot of color and only wore those stereotypical black and white clothes for special occasions <|endoftext|> That's news to me. did you know that there is a store in alabama that sells clothes, cameras and other stuff left at baggage claim.
 <|endoftext|> do you like cars? <|endoftext|> I sure do . DO you know who invented the drive thru?
 <|endoftext|> What is your favorite animal? <|endoftext|> Hi. It's hard to choose. I like so many. I mean, after all there over 7 million different species on the planet.  If I had to pick off the top of my head I would say dogs, horses, and killer whales.  What are your favorites?
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm doing well. How about you?
 <|endoftext|> Hello,  did you know there about 20 quintillion individual animals on the planet earth? <|endoftext|> That's a lot of species of animals! And they all have a dominant side like we do with our writing and such
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> fine and you ?
 <|endoftext|> do you like cars? <|endoftext|> I love cars. DO you know when the drive thru was invented?
 <|endoftext|> Good Morning, do you drive a car? <|endoftext|> I do drive a car.  I think it's crazy that it's legal in South Africa to attach a flame thrower to your car!
 <|endoftext|> hi how are you? <|endoftext|> I am good.  It is amazing to me how much technology is intertwined in our daily lives.  People cannot live without their Iphones
 <|endoftext|> hi how are you? do you listen to the radio these days? <|endoftext|> Hello!  Yes I do!  I haven't listened to any classic rado dramas thorugh lately.
 <|endoftext|> Good afternoon to you. Do you use Google very often?It was founded in 1998. <|endoftext|> Hello!  Yes, I use Google extremely often, I find.  I am always online in one way or another and constantly looking things up.  
 <|endoftext|> Hi! Are you an animal lover? <|endoftext|> Yeah I am an animal lover, what about you?
 <|endoftext|> Hello there, do you listen to the radio much these days? <|endoftext|> I do try to, but I have heard there are huge pay gaps. 
 <|endoftext|> A lot of animals in our planet <|endoftext|> True.  its been said that animals developed white patches on their foreheads when domesticated.  I can't figure out why.  Any thoughts?
 <|endoftext|> do you like cars? <|endoftext|> I do. DO you know when the drive thru was invented?
 <|endoftext|> Do you know many facts about governments? <|endoftext|> Some of them, like how the government owns 86% of the land in Nevada, what about you ?
 <|endoftext|> I recently listened to a podcast and they said the three biggest problems with working from home was th couch, refridgerator, and bed. Do you work from home?  <|endoftext|> No, unfortunately I can't do that.  It's kinda like the Washington DC situation where there are security concerns about accessing internet with sensitive material.  
 <|endoftext|> Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! :) <|endoftext|> Me too. Been in a good mood so hopefully this will be fun!
 <|endoftext|> Good morning, do you telecommute? <|endoftext|> Sometimes I get to telecommute. Do you get a chance to?
 <|endoftext|> what do you think about kids owning cell phones <|endoftext|> Hello,  I think it depends on their age and what restictions you can put on it.  Have you ever seen 13 reasons why?  It put a whole new perspective on how I view kids having cell phones. 
 <|endoftext|> Do you listen to the radio?  <|endoftext|> Hello,  yes sometimes,  how about yourself?
 <|endoftext|> Did ypou know that by using radio waves sound  and other information can be transmitted through space. <|endoftext|> Thats really interesting! Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio.
 <|endoftext|> Do you use Facebook? <|endoftext|> Here and there to find out what people are up to, but I don't really like what a mess it's become. I think it's absurd that 30% of American adults use it as their primary news source.
 <|endoftext|> Good evening <|endoftext|> Good evening.  Do you Jupiter has radio storms that can be picked up and heard by am radion
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> I'm good!  Are you a fan of dramas?
 <|endoftext|> Do you like basketball? <|endoftext|> I think I like drama better. What about you? Did you know the classic two faces symbol for drama represents comedy and tragedy?
 <|endoftext|> Hello!  Are you a basketball fan? <|endoftext|> I love basketball, how about you?
 <|endoftext|> Basketball season seems to be getting exciting.  Good game with the Wizards and the CLippers the other day. They won after being down. See the game? <|endoftext|> I didn't, but heard something about it. I believe it was the first game where Beal and Wall each scored 20 points in a half as teammates.
 <|endoftext|> I never was big into playing basketball, but I loved to watch it.  Especially people like Kareem Abdul Jabbar and his dunks. <|endoftext|> Yes, me too! Did you know that dunking was band for 10 years since Kareem had such a dominant dunk and game play.
 <|endoftext|> hey there, do you watch NBA? <|endoftext|> Yes, I love to watch basketball.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|> did You know that Hugh laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama, earning $700,000 per episode in "House" ? <|endoftext|> no.  I did not know about that fact.  But he is one of my favorite actors
 <|endoftext|> Do you watch basketball? <|endoftext|> I do watch some.  I heard it was invented by the ymca.  Do you watch?
 <|endoftext|> Interesting, John Wicks who is a U.K. pop genius once called Virginia home.  <|endoftext|> Don't think I've ever heard of him. Did you know that Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million in early 2005?
 <|endoftext|> Hello, are you by any chance an NBA fan, and if so, what's your favorite team? <|endoftext|> I dont really have a favorite team anymore. I jut like to watch it sometimes. I think the NBA has the best athletes of any sport in the world.
 <|endoftext|> Hi! Are you a fan of college sports? I remember from that movie, Rudy, that Villanova University has a really intense football team and culture surrounding it. <|endoftext|> well I like professional stuff more personally, likeI think its funny the dunk was banned in the NBA for a while
 <|endoftext|> Hi, do you like basketball? <|endoftext|> It's okay. Not my favorite. You?
 <|endoftext|> Hello.  Do you like basketball? <|endoftext|> Yes, do you? We go to the games.

 <|endoftext|> Hi!  Do you watch basketball? <|endoftext|> Yea, I'm a huge knicks fan but follow the other 29 teams in the NBA, you?
 <|endoftext|> Hello, it is crazy to find out that either a college football and basketball coach get a high pay. <|endoftext|> There's television revenue and the alumni want winning teams. Consider that Stan van Gundy was fined for saying something that would lower $$$ for the NBA.
 <|endoftext|> Are You an NBA fan ? <|endoftext|> Not really, but Porter played well in the 4th quarter for the Wizards.
 <|endoftext|> Do you like basketball?  <|endoftext|> I do like it and have a passing familiarity

Campaigns are expensive.  Did you know up until 1905, the runner up would become Vice President?  I can imagine all the fighting that would have caused!

 <|endoftext|> I've always enjoyed reading. How about yourself? <|endoftext|> Hi! I have to some extent but I can see why people find it boring, at least books can be interpreted differently by each person which makes them interesting,

I'm surprised it's not more popular in the US since it's played by 250 million people in the world. <|endoftext|> I don't actually but I don't like many sports.

 <|endoftext|> Hi, are you a football fan? <|endoftext|> Hi! I am , i love football. Are you referring to soccer or american football? I like both. Football can mean so many different things... association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. 
 <|endoftext|> I'm surprised to read that MLS cannot find a suitable venue for DC United to play its home opener at.  Given how much money soccer makes world wide, you would think they have a good arena for them. <|endoftext|> It makes more than every other sport combined.

 <|endoftext|> Do you like football? <|endoftext|> I know very little about football. I do know about the team the patriots and Tom Brady. I recently learned of a player on that team that has never fumbled a ball.
 <|endoftext|> Hi!  Do you follow world cup soccer? <|endoftext|> Not really, how about you? Maybe I should follow the American women's team as they have not placed below third place since the start of the world cup in 1991.

 <|endoftext|> HOw's it going, do you follow football? The university of Iowa has a pink lockerroom for visiting teams <|endoftext|> Yes, I follow football somewhat.  I guess that's to psych out the opposing team.  lol. Did you know that back in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football players?  My, how times have changed.
 <|endoftext|> Do you have any interest in FIFA? <|endoftext|> personally I don't haha, I don' watch sports but I guess the world cup will be in 2022 in Qatar, what about you?

 <|endoftext|> Do you like facebook? <|endoftext|> I actully hate it. to easy for people to spread lies. Much like Alex Jones
 <|endoftext|> Do you like to use the internet?  It seems like I'm constantly using it. <|endoftext|> Yes it feels like I am always online as well. Do you use Facebook?
 <|endoftext|> Good Afternoon!  The internet is a weird place with weird "stars"  and "celebrities" - makes my head spin... <|endoftext|> hi, how are you? is it afternoon where you are? it is night here on the dark side of the moon. is the internet getting weird again?
 <|endoftext|> Good morning. <|endoftext|> Good morning. Are you a soccer fan?
 <|endoftext|> Hey how are you, you know much about Association football by chance?

 <|endoftext|> Do you use the telephone anymore? <|endoftext|> I do. It allows one to conduct a conversation with another even though they may be far apart. It is a very efficient form of communication.
 <|endoftext|> Do you like to watch soccer? <|endoftext|> No I can't say that I do haha. I think soccer is really boring, what about you?
 <|endoftext|> Hello there, do you watch the World Cup when it comes around? <|endoftext|> I try to. It's soccer at the highest level.

 <|endoftext|> do you lkike football? <|endoftext|> I love it. U of Iowa painted the visitor locker room pink

 <|endoftext|> Hello, are you particularly interested in politics? <|endoftext|> Yes. I am but I am not radical about it. Are you interested mostly in your local politics or in the national scene?
 <|endoftext|> Hello - how are you doing today? <|endoftext|> Im doing great did you hear about James Shar Jr and his act of heroism?
 <|endoftext|> Have you ever been to the white house? <|endoftext|> Hi, I have been at the entrance but never inside. Did you know the white house has twin buildings in Ireland and France?
 <|endoftext|> Do you like to garden? <|endoftext|> Not really! do you?
 <|endoftext|> Jos Roozen seems like quite a guy, a lot of knowledge about plants and gardening indeed. <|endoftext|> yes I think he developed an interest in saltwater fish of all things, saltwater fish actually drink water through their mouth while freshwater fish absorb water through their skin

 <|endoftext|> Where is the White House located? <|endoftext|> 1600 Pennsylvania Ave... Why do you ask?
 <|endoftext|> Wow, more Trump bashing, how novel. I just was gagging reading an article, "Has Trump finally gone to far?"  I my opinion, it's the biased press that's going too far. <|endoftext|> I agree, The news is so upsetting.
 <|endoftext|> Good Morning! I'm not much interested in the White House, but I do root for President Trump <|endoftext|> So do I.  I hope he succeeds with some of his initiatives.  I wonder if he'll want to take the solar panels off the back of the white house that George Bush had installed.
 <|endoftext|> Greetings!  <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you doing?
 <|endoftext|> How do you feel about boarder security and the fact families are being separated at the boarder? <|endoftext|> That is a difficult issue since mistreatment of children is sad and may be comparable to what happened in Nazi concentration camps when you see that  2000 kids were taken from their families 
 <|endoftext|> How's it going? Are you interested in past US Presidents? During Teddy Roosevelt's presidency christmas trees were banned from the white house <|endoftext|> He did? that sounds like something the Grinch would do lol, I think its important to follow politics.
 <|endoftext|> Did you know the GOP was liberal until Barry Goldwater in 1964. <|endoftext|> I did not know that. Very interesting. There hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or a democrat since 1853.
 <|endoftext|> Are you comfortable talking about the government? <|endoftext|> For sure. They are everywhere after all. Even on WIkileaks pages
 <|endoftext|> Hi! Are you a YouTube junkie too? <|endoftext|> haha yes I am! I don't have cable I only do youtube, I guess there is about 400 hours of content uploaded every minute

 <|endoftext|> Good Evening. I was just reading about radios made with a pencil and a razor blade. I would like to see that done! <|endoftext|> Ya that does sound interesting! I thought it was funny that canadian law has 40% of all music played required to be canadian haha
 <|endoftext|> Are you a Linkin Park fan?  They are great. They played 324 concerts in 2001. I still can´t believe it. <|endoftext|> I am I think they are one of the best bands ever, too bad the leading singer committed suicide, maybe the toll of many concerts made him fall into depression. 
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you?? <|endoftext|> Im great, so what are your thoughts on Trumps Ex Lawyer, I think Trump is guilty.
 <|endoftext|> Hey there! Have you heard about the crazy things President Duterte has been doing to the media in the Philippines recently? <|endoftext|> Yeah Ive heard, seems like freedom of the press is coming to an end in the Philippines, he denounced all mayor news outlets there. 
 <|endoftext|> Michael Cohen said he was in contact with Russians to build a Trump hotel in Moscow during the 2016 campaign. <|endoftext|> Hi. He did-what happened?

 <|endoftext|> Hi.  <|endoftext|> Hello how are you? Interesting article about soybeans.

 <|endoftext|> hi, do you know the website wikileaks? <|endoftext|> Yea, it publishes top secret stuff and the US government wants to stop it
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that, according to Canadian law, 40% of the music on the radio must be by Canadian artists? That would explain why Drake is so popular.  <|endoftext|> No I didn't actually it seems like that might be the case for Justin Bieber as well his song 'baby' is the most disliked video on youtube
 <|endoftext|> Hello there, did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house? <|endoftext|> I had heard that.  I think the guest house is newer.
 <|endoftext|> Hey have you ever been to a concert? <|endoftext|> Lots! Lucky to have come from a family that was very into music. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concert in 2001? That seems like a crazy schedule.

 <|endoftext|> Hi!  I didn't know that there was a type of soccer where three teams play at once.  Wonder how that works? <|endoftext|> Fascinating.  I imagine the better two of the teams would just try to put it past the weakest defense.  Or maybe the scoring is different?
 <|endoftext|> Good morning!  Do you follow presidential history? <|endoftext|> I don't know much but I find it very interesting, especially the crazy way elections used to work.

They seem to focus on drama and making people tense and afraid.  I've watched some Fox News knowing it has a republican bias but I have found that it is sometimes more balanced and unbiased in it's approach.

 <|endoftext|> did you know the senate used a gavel for over 160 years before richard nixon finally cracked it <|endoftext|> That's crazy, it was definitely built to last. There's not many things that would last that long. 
 <|endoftext|> Hi, Did you know that YouTube originated with three guys from PayPal who later sold the site to Google? <|endoftext|> I saw that fact when I read the information and I was really surprised there was a connection between PayPal an YouTube.

I hope his arm lasts him to adulthood. <|endoftext|> Yes, I like baseball but I would let my son get abused like that.  I realize its a tournament but that's crazy.
 <|endoftext|> Hi do you know that baseball is so popular in Japan <|endoftext|> Yes. But controversial, too. Understand young high school pitchers have really high pitch counts- all to win.

 <|endoftext|> Do you like basketball? I read that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade. <|endoftext|> I bet. Kareem was a beast on the court. Gheorghe Muresan was one of the tallest players in the NBA. He was 7'7.

 <|endoftext|> Do you watch tv shows? On tv or internet? <|endoftext|> I only watch on TV.  I do stream some but I still put them on my smart TV rather than a computer.  I use the LED technology but if I had a smaller screen I would use OLED.

I actually have my pilot's license so my favorite method is hands down a plane :D   Possibly I'm related to King Kalakaua from Hawaii with my desire to travel near and far? 
 <|endoftext|> hi, do you travel? <|endoftext|> I do, both for work and business. I'm usually always on the go. I wish I had that commuter bus that the Dutch are creating that goes 160mph.

 <|endoftext|> Do you like concerts? <|endoftext|> i do, but i dont really have the time or money to go these days. i used to go a lot. what about you?
 <|endoftext|> Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001.  <|endoftext|> That's unreal,  I guess they had only two places to be either on stage or on the tour bus; no time for anything else.  While concerts are generally loud, some are louder than others. Did you know the Foo Fighters did a concert in New Zealand that was so loud it was picked up on seismic monitors?
 <|endoftext|> Hi, are you into cars, radios, or clothing? <|endoftext|> I love cars. Do you know how Cadillac got its name?

 <|endoftext|> Hi there what do you know about the White House? <|endoftext|> I know that the Guest House is bigger than the white house. 
 <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy cars? <|endoftext|> I lease a car but I do not own a car and I don't care too much for cars. I am very interested in sociopolitical events, though, and I am deeply saddened to hear of the news that Detective Jacai Colson was killed under friendly fire. Did you hear about this?
 <|endoftext|> An undercover detective holding his badge and shouting "police, police" was shot and killed by police in Maryland. <|endoftext|> Cat-like reflexes, trained to perform at the highest level, equipped with the finest weapons and trained to distinguish between friend and foe...did this to a fellow law enforcement professional. This is dangerous work with genuine risk. My hearts go out to all involved. Were there flame throwers involved? If this was South Africa, cars can legally be equipped with those.  Talk about deterrent!
 <|endoftext|> So what do you think about president trump? <|endoftext|> I'm not a fan of the way he is going about things but I respect the office of president.

 <|endoftext|> I wonder what the media would say about Teddy Rosevelt and Quincy Adams not using a Bible at their inaugurals today <|endoftext|> They would probably applaud for the most part.  I find it amazing that Jefferson cut out the supernatural parts of the Bible.

 <|endoftext|> Hello,  how are you ? The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana <|endoftext|> I am well. That's pretty funny! The top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson

 <|endoftext|> Hi! Hope you're having a good day. Have you been following all the drama around Michael Cohen?? <|endoftext|> No, who is he? 
 <|endoftext|> The ACLU claims to not support either political party.  Huge lie.  The ACLU is so left it is totally in bed with democrats.  The want control of how Comey's private files are reviewed. <|endoftext|> Did you know monaco eliminated income tax in 1869?
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the government?  <|endoftext|> No, I did not. That is crazy. I usually do not think of the government as land owners. 
 <|endoftext|> Hi, do you use facebook? <|endoftext|> I do!  Wish I had created it.  I would probably be super rich now.  lol
 <|endoftext|> Hey there do you use Facebook? What do you think about Mark Zuckerberg? <|endoftext|> I think that he is a dude who is in charge of a massively different product that he anticipated

 <|endoftext|> I spend a lot of time on YouTube. How about you? <|endoftext|> I spend a little time on it looking at how to videos. What do you watch?
 <|endoftext|> I got so angry when I heard about that black man getting arrested <|endoftext|> I feel the same way. I don't know how they could smell marijuana in his pocket.
 <|endoftext|> Do you like to listen to the radio? <|endoftext|> I do, usually while driving.  Nothing like that Finnish station which broadcasts in classical Latin though.

 <|endoftext|> Do you use television for entertainment? <|endoftext|> no, I am more into streaming. I really like Netflix.
 <|endoftext|> Wow I wonder why Orange is the new black is so noteworthy. I have never seen one episode, have you? <|endoftext|> I have, I like it, too bad the series got cancelled.
 <|endoftext|> Do you have a favorite Netflix show? They've come so far since Lilyhammer. <|endoftext|> Honestly, the subscription is worth it just for the OFfice sometimes. Did you know they account for 33% of all bandwidth at night?
 <|endoftext|> Hi, do you like television? <|endoftext|> I like it, some shows more than others.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|> Netflix is an American media service found in 1997 by Reed hastings and Marc randolph. <|endoftext|> That's quite interesting. Do you have a Netflix subscription?
 <|endoftext|> Have you heard about the Orange is the New Black Cancellation?  They are cancelling after seven seasons. <|endoftext|> i guess they ran out of stories. i dont really know the show. seven seasons? that is a good run.
 <|endoftext|> Have you watched "13 Reasons Why" on Netflix? <|endoftext|> I have not, but lets talk about Netflix. They spend a lot of money on postage, even more then bandwidth 
 <|endoftext|> So Mo'Nique is boycotting Netflix? <|endoftext|> Yea, I guess she wanted more money.
 <|endoftext|> Hey!  Wach any good Netflix movies lately? <|endoftext|> I did not watch 13 reasons why, but i do like Jessica Jones

 <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy baseball? <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? Yes, I enjoy baseball. I usually try to watch the World Series.
 <|endoftext|> Good morning! How are you today? <|endoftext|> Im great, do you like baseball?
 <|endoftext|> What physical means does the telephone use to transmit sound? <|endoftext|> Im not sure what it means what Im surprised by is the power of the Iphone
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> hey I'm good, did you know that dolphins can communicate though phones and understand each otehr?
 <|endoftext|> do you like drama? <|endoftext|> Yes I do. Did you know JOn Hamm was a high school teacher for drama
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> Good!  How often do you use the internet?
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that 80% of the earth's natural forests are destroyed already? <|endoftext|> That is so sad considering we humans would only represent a minute and seventeen seconds if we viewed its history as a 24 hour period. And we've already destroyed so much it.
 <|endoftext|> hi, do you know much about the earth? <|endoftext|> I know that we as humans are not doing a good job of taking care of it, we have already destroyed 80% of the natural forests.
 <|endoftext|> Hello, are you particularly interested in politics? <|endoftext|> I try to stay out of politics but unfortunately I do get sucked into it sometimes haha. I did see that Wikileaks was going to be destroyed by the US government apparently, and then Wikileaks leak that plan haha that's so crazy
 <|endoftext|> hey my friend do you watch TV? <|endoftext|> I do like watching TV, do you have any favorite shows?
 <|endoftext|> Hi! Can you believe the three wealthiest presidents of all time were Jefferson, Washington and JFK? <|endoftext|> Hi! Washington and jFK makes sense, this is probably a bit out of date (i.e., Trump). The president of indonesia released 3 pop albums in office. Multi talented!
 <|endoftext|> Good morning!  Do you like to play any video games? <|endoftext|> I do, its one of my favorite activities, do you?
 <|endoftext|> Hey! <|endoftext|> How are you today?
 <|endoftext|> Theres a store in alabama that sells items left at airports <|endoftext|> Wouldn't that be fun to go to?
 <|endoftext|> Do you watch a lot of tele or tv? <|endoftext|> hey there, dI do watch some, have you ever watched Pokemon?
 <|endoftext|> Hello Friend.  Do you want to talk about clothing?  Did you know that Pilgrim clothing was full of color and that they only wore black for special occasions?  Doesn't that seem strange? <|endoftext|> I guess people dont like the normal. the abnormal makes for interesting narrative. the pilgrims were just folks like you and me. 
 <|endoftext|> What type of entertainment do you enjoy? <|endoftext|> Hi, I enjoy quite a few different things. Tops on my list is probably video games. I read that in total the planet plays about 3 billion hours of video games a week.
 <|endoftext|> Hello, How are you today? <|endoftext|> Good morning; I am doing great today thank you for asking!
 <|endoftext|> Episcopal is a private boarding school in Alexandria with a lot of diversity. <|endoftext|> Yes I have heard that it is a very beautiful school. Are you familiar with David Zeng by chance?
 <|endoftext|> Hi there, do you like the NFL games <|endoftext|> Hi there I sure do. Did you know snoop dogg wrote a song for his son's school team?
 <|endoftext|> Do you know what the highest scoring football game was? <|endoftext|> No, 150-ish  ?
 <|endoftext|> Hello and good morning. You a basketball fan? I used to play a lot. I like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar he was very dominant. His dunk was crazy. <|endoftext|> Yes I am a basketball fan. I follow the NBA more than I follow college basketball. Who is your favorite team?
 <|endoftext|> There are so very odd facts about the united states government. I wonder if the same can be said for other countries.  <|endoftext|> I'm sure there is. I find it odd that every US president with a beard has been Republican. 
 <|endoftext|> Hello! Do you have a favorite football team? <|endoftext|> hi, how are you? no i dont. i dont really know the sport well. You?
 <|endoftext|> Hi!  Do you follow the government? <|endoftext|> A little the Republican party is also called the GOP.
 <|endoftext|> Hello there! <|endoftext|> Hello, do you know Paul Manafort, former Trump campain chairman
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? What do you think of government? <|endoftext|> I like it but do not like some of the players. You?
 <|endoftext|> Do you consume the news a lot? <|endoftext|> Not really. I don't like all the negativity although I am guilty of getting news form social media like facebook.
 <|endoftext|> What are your thoughs on media? <|endoftext|> I think it's very important for people to stay informed and also as equally important to not be biased by what you see and that certain publications are biased vs others, what about you?
 <|endoftext|> Good morning! Are you a fan of football? <|endoftext|> Good morning. Yes. which is your favourite football team ?
 <|endoftext|> do you like the band Kiss? I like them a lot, I guess they bought into an arena football team <|endoftext|> I do enjoy their music.  I think its cool that they offered a contract to Tim Tebow to play.
 <|endoftext|> Have you heard that Trump is apparently worried over the Manafort trial? It's been in the news lately. <|endoftext|> Yeah, Paul Manafort is quite the character, as is Trump. Trump was evidently quoted saying he didn't understand why the government didn't tell him Manafort was under investigation.
 <|endoftext|> What do you think about the company Trump keeps like Paul manafort? <|endoftext|> I think it is questionable.  Obviously the problem is two-fold for Trump.  The types he associates with and when he endorses someone, that stamp of approval does not mean much.
 <|endoftext|> Hi! Are you a football fan? <|endoftext|> I watch some football on occasion.
 <|endoftext|> Hi! Do you follow the government at all? I find it awfully ironic that Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy them. Ha! <|endoftext|> I've always followed the government closely. Unfortunately it's become a reality show lately so it's been even easier to follow. Ha - Assange is never getting out of Ecuador.
 <|endoftext|> Do you like football? <|endoftext|> Yes, college mainly. Did you know the U. of Iowa has a pink locker room for the visiting team?
 <|endoftext|> Do you enjoy sports? <|endoftext|> Yeah, for the most part. Do you?
 <|endoftext|> Do you have an interest in politics? <|endoftext|> Yes I do, why are Americans so hard on president Trump?
 <|endoftext|> Do you follow politics? <|endoftext|> Yes, I dont like Trump, how about you?
 <|endoftext|> "The mistrust of the media is so extreme among Republicans that 40 percent consider otherwise accurate news stories to be "fake news" if the stories cast a politician or political group in a negative light. " I find that number to be really more than I thought... <|endoftext|> Do you think the news is fake?
 <|endoftext|> Hello,  hows it going?  did you know the Presidents guest house is bigger than the white house?  That is crazy! <|endoftext|> I did hear that. pomp and circumstance. Apparently the president of Indonesia has 3 pop album. 
 <|endoftext|> Iowa's guest locker room for football teams is painted pink, hilarious! <|endoftext|> LOL.  I know all about it being a Nebraska fan who has had teams play there!  Are you a fan of football?
 <|endoftext|> do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|> I know some stuff. DO you know who are the three wealthiest us presidents?
 <|endoftext|> Do you get a lot of news from the media? <|endoftext|> I try to stick with larger media outlets.  I follow news aggregators, like Drudge and then for issues I am interested, I get info from different sources to weed out biases.  Media is still important but needs to report more and opine less.  I think that's the gist of the Gallup poll.  Your thoughts?
 <|endoftext|> Episcopal High School is great for learning football and bonding as a team.  It is very diverse as well. <|endoftext|> Yeah I heard it is a good school.  I guess the student population there is 445. 
 <|endoftext|> Hello. How are you? <|endoftext|> Hey!  I am doing well, enjoying my Sunday.  How are you?  Getting ready to watch some college basketball this afternoon.  The brainchild of James Naismith! Are you a fan?
 <|endoftext|> I was sad to see that Charlotte Rae died.  I loved the show The Facts of Life when I was young <|endoftext|> I've never seen a show but I did hear good things. She actually was nominated for an Emmy for her work on Broadway which I think is cool
 <|endoftext|> Hello do you enjoy watching the telly? <|endoftext|> I don't watch so much now. I use the computer mostly. You?
 <|endoftext|> Did you watch The Facts of Life?  <|endoftext|> Yeah I though it was a great show, too bad Charlotte Rae did although she was old.
 <|endoftext|> I can't believe ABC brought back Last Man Standing. <|endoftext|> I have never seen it.  I don't really watch much TV
 <|endoftext|> Hey! Did you hear that actress Charlotte Rae passed, she was the house mother on the factss of Life, so sad. <|endoftext|> It is sad. She did have a long life though. She lived to 92. I hope I make it that long.
 <|endoftext|> Hello! How are you tonight? <|endoftext|> Hi, I am doing great.  Do you want to chat about drama, television, or comedy?  It's your choice.

 <|endoftext|> Humans are amazing! we have evolved into smart species.  <|endoftext|> hi how are you? we are a very smart species. we dont have much hair though!
 <|endoftext|> Hi!  Im a human, yet there are so many facts about being human I didnt even know!  how about you? <|endoftext|> That is true.     Humans are the only current members of Hominina.
 <|endoftext|> Hello,  did you know humans have a defective gene and cannot produce our own vitamin c? <|endoftext|> I heard that before, even though most plants and animals make their own vitamin C.  Did you hear that there is a certain sound frequency that causes fear in humans? I wonder what it is?
 <|endoftext|> The White House is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. and has been there since 1800 and I have never been.  Have you? <|endoftext|> I've never been, though I want to go.The White House seems behind the curve technologically. W. had solar panels put back on the White House. Reagan had them taken off. I wonder why Clinton didn’t put them back on. Floppy disks? I wonder if they have laser printers yet. Or mice. 
 <|endoftext|> Good day. Do you follow politics? <|endoftext|> I do.  It is hard not to follow it nowadays.  The president is always in the news
 <|endoftext|> I didn't know that The top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson <|endoftext|> Neither did I, I wouldn't have guessed it was them. I've also never heard that until 1805 the runner up in the presidential election became V.P. Do you think they should bring this back?
 <|endoftext|> Did you know that Nevada is 86% owned by the government?  <|endoftext|> I figure that the govt must be doing something out in that desert. Experiment? Military games? Alien landings? LOL
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you doing on this fine day? <|endoftext|> Hi! I am doing great and just finished catching up on the news, how about you?

 <|endoftext|> hi how are you doing? <|endoftext|> Not too bad, what's your view on the trade negotiations?
 <|endoftext|> Hey have you ever heard of dick Goodwin? <|endoftext|> Not alot, He helped Lyndon B. Johnson's vision of a great society!
 <|endoftext|> Hi. Have you ever visited Washington, D.C.? <|endoftext|> No i haven't yet but I'd like to. Have you?  I'd like to see the White house.  It was built back in 1800.
 <|endoftext|> hello did you know the presidents guest house is bigger than the white house? <|endoftext|> Yes, I new that very interesting. Did you know the Eiffel Tower was sold twice?
 <|endoftext|> hi there, do you know much about the presidents? <|endoftext|> I know a little. How about you?
 <|endoftext|> hey there, do you know much about politics? <|endoftext|> About average but I do stay informed.  For example, Trump seems to be following precedent in regard to mixing business and recreation on travel.
 <|endoftext|> Hello there, do you follow politics much? <|endoftext|> I do a little bit, but I think I like history more. I like knowing how it all works out. Like the first President to move into the White House was Thomas Jefferson in 1801.
 <|endoftext|> Do you watch the news and follow politics? <|endoftext|> I do, I follow news on the government, It makes me mad when they try to censor free speech

 <|endoftext|> Do you follow politics,? <|endoftext|> Not much, I should follow what the government is doing. And you ?
 <|endoftext|> hey there, do you like tv? <|endoftext|> I usually don't watch live TV anymore, but rather I stream them online afterwards. Still, it's a big part of life. Have you ever seen the show Shark Tank?
 <|endoftext|> Do you watch tv? <|endoftext|> I do! Especially Family guy and the Simpsons, how about you?
 <|endoftext|> Did you know the 3 horizontal lines on a menu app is called a hamburger button? <|endoftext|> No, i did not.  That is interesting.   I wonder who named it, Ronald McDonald?
 <|endoftext|> hi, how are you? do you like dogs? <|endoftext|> Hi there! I am doing great. How are you? Yeah, dogs are really smart. Dogs and elephants are the only animals that can instinctively understand pointing.

 <|endoftext|> Hello do you like television? <|endoftext|> I love watching television, how about you?
 <|endoftext|> Do you watch tv? <|endoftext|> Yes I do.  I watch some shark tank and was shocked to learn recently that most of the deals made are never acted upon.
 <|endoftext|> hello. <|endoftext|> Hi there!  Do you watch Netflix?

 <|endoftext|> Man I ended up finding out yesterday that both Netflix and youtube make up half of internet traffic in America. That's crazy. <|endoftext|> It is crazy but not surprising to me. I think kids make up most of the You Tube Users with watching other children open gifts, I will never understand the thrill of watching that.
 <|endoftext|> Are you a big t.v. fan? <|endoftext|> Yes,  absolutely! When south park aired its family guy episode finale the producers received flowers from the simpsons crew

 <|endoftext|> Hi. Have you heard of Chris Rock's show "Tambourine"? <|endoftext|> I did hear about that show, that's his new one right? I think the tour before this was called "Total Blackout" right
 <|endoftext|> Are you a Chris Rock fan? <|endoftext|> I am not. However, I do have a lot of respect for him, for owning up to his faults as a husband, and bringing porn addiction into the light.
 <|endoftext|> Do you like Rap?  <|endoftext|> Yes. I like learning about rappers too. The rapper 6ix9ine sounds like not a great guy. He recently attacked a 16 year old fan.
 <|endoftext|> Hello, did you know the car Cadillac was named after a French explorer by the same name? <|endoftext|> Or that the trunk of the car is called trunk because cars used to carry wooden trunks on the back?
 <|endoftext|> do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|> Yes I do. You can listen to Jupiter's storms in am radio
 <|endoftext|> I wonder what made someone think that Tupac's music was culturally significant.  <|endoftext|> Me too.  I had no idea Eminem really wanted to be a comic book artist.  That's quite a talent.

 <|endoftext|> You travel much? Want to try out the 160mph commuter bus the dutch are working on? <|endoftext|> I would love too, as Japan's toll roads are so expensive if you want to really see the country.
 <|endoftext|> I know people have strong opinions, but to direct it at a boy scout seems to go a little too far. <|endoftext|> Yea, the use of an anti-gay slur on a child is appalling 
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? what do you think of the internet? <|endoftext|> I think it is ok, maybe a bit addictive though.

 <|endoftext|> Jupiter has radio storms so strong that they can be picked up and heard by an am radio.i did not know that! Did you? <|endoftext|> No I didn't even know our radio waves were affected by other planets. What other crazy facts do you know about the radio.
 <|endoftext|> It's amazing how far technology has advanced.  It wasn't even that long ago - within a few generations - that we didn't even have telephones.  Now the US nuclear icbm deterrent is much weaker than an iphone!  A iphone!  It doesn't even seem possible considering the size of the hardware involved. <|endoftext|> Yeah, it's crazy how far we have come.  
 <|endoftext|> Dancing is a way of expressing joy and amount of happiness either it is money motivated or not <|endoftext|> Never been much of a dancer to tell the truth, nor do I like these shows like Dancing With the Stars.

 <|endoftext|> Do you use facebook? <|endoftext|> Hi, I do. I really wish I had invested in it too, but I missed that boat. Not as bad as myspace who had the chance to buy facebook for just 75 million.
 <|endoftext|> Did you hear about the shooting at the Capital Gazetter Newspaper? a real tragedy <|endoftext|> Yes, it was.  I can sympathize with the writer of the article when he said that he was feeling like a kid.

 <|endoftext|> Good morning! If you use an Android device, you are contributing to the traffic on  Google maps, as they track how fast android devices are moving. <|endoftext|> Good morning!

 <|endoftext|> hi, do you use facebook? <|endoftext|> Yes, I use Facebook. Every day but with caution. lol

 <|endoftext|> hi how are you? do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|> Hey partner! Yeah I listen to the radio in the car usually. It's pretty cool that it can modulate properties of electromagnetic energy to create sound.
 <|endoftext|> Hello,  how are you ? Mcdonalds' added drive-thru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their fatigues. <|endoftext|> That was a smart move on their part. Now, drive-thrus are popular with so many people- it may even be encouraging people to not get up and walk around!

 <|endoftext|> Do you follow the presidency? <|endoftext|> To some degree.  The president is the title for head of state in most republics. Where I grew up, they are titled Prime Ministers.
 <|endoftext|> This is one of those rummors I had heard about prior to Hannibel Burress and it made me so sad. This and the Clippers owner being racist were both really sad.  <|endoftext|> The Clippers owner and the Bill Cosby accusations are both disgusting and sad. They both need to be put away for a long time

 <|endoftext|> Did you know that in new zealand, their basketball team is nicknamed the "tall blacks", don't think that would fly over here <|endoftext|> I was unaware of that. In the US the supreme court building has a basketball court on the top floor. 
 <|endoftext|> Hello. Do you watch sports much? <|endoftext|> I do! I like basketball, though I was never very good as a kid as I'm not very tall. How about you?

 <|endoftext|> Hi!  What do you know about the Telephone? <|endoftext|> I know its a communication device that connects 2 or more users together.
 <|endoftext|> What do you think about the Catholic Church? It scares me that they don't have a system in place for reporting misconduct <|endoftext|> I think something needs to be done about that, immediately. Too many bishops are getting away with this. Like the one in West  Virginia.
 <|endoftext|> Hi. Do you like to travel? What is your favorite mode of transportation? <|endoftext|> I love air travel even though it's 10% slower than it was in the 1960s as they try to save on fuel costs now. What about you?
 <|endoftext|> Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|> hey I'm good, can you guess how much Judge Judy makes per episode?

 <|endoftext|> How long will Trump remain president of the United States? That's the real question!  <|endoftext|> I don't know. did you know the top three wealthiest presidents are jfk washington and jefferson
 <|endoftext|> Did you know 7% of people actually read the full TOS when buying products and apps online? <|endoftext|> I'm shocked that it's that high actually haha. I know that I never read those things haha. Other shocking thing is that there is actually 3-g cell service at the top of Mount Everest, good to know that I'll be able to post on Facebook while I'm hiking haha

 <|endoftext|> Do you keep up with any celebrities?  <|endoftext|> Not really, most of them are complete idiots.  I do remember the SNL Celebrity Jeopardy skit.  The Burt Reynolds character was hilarious.
 <|endoftext|> I've heard that religion and politics are some of the most uncomfortable things one can discuss with others. With that in mind, I'm all in on the Bull Moose party. Yourself? <|endoftext|> I've actually never heard of the Bull Moose party.  As far as politics go I would say I am currently for the republican party, otherwise known as the grand old party.
 <|endoftext|> did you know new yorks area code is 212 because it was the fastest to dial on a rotary phone? crazy huh <|endoftext|> Sort of makes sense.  I saw a couple of 17 year olds who were given a rotary phone and 4 minutes to make a call and they could not figure it out. The cables across the ocean just lay on the floor.  I don't know how else they would manage them.
 <|endoftext|> hello,  how are you?  did you know The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana <|endoftext|> I'm good, thank you, no I didn't! That is quite funny.  Do you know who the last u.s. president to speak a foreign language fluently was?

 <|endoftext|> Hi there! How are you? I'm hanging out watching Netflix. Can't believe it was founded in 1997. <|endoftext|> I'm doing good. Yeah, I can't believe it all started because Reed Jastings had a $40 late fee for a VHS

 <|endoftext|> It's hard to say whether it's black and white, but I think each department has a responsibility to figure out what's best for their own officers. <|endoftext|> I would encourage police to shoot through their windshield if it meant saving lives and stopping criminals.
 <|endoftext|> Hi, do you like to travel? <|endoftext|> I used to.  Nowadays travel has gotten too cramped and unpleasant for me.  Do you like to travel?

 <|endoftext|> Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques – including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".
This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals. <|endoftext|> Dublin (; Irish: Baile Átha Cliath, pronounced [ˈbˠalʲə aːhə ˈclʲiə] or [ˌbʲlʲaː ˈclʲiə]) is the capital and largest city of Ireland. On a bay at the mouth of the River Liffey, it is in the province of Leinster, bordered on the south by the Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains range. At the 2016 census it had a population of 1,173,179, while the preliminary results of the 2022 census recorded that County Dublin as a whole had a population of 1,450,701, and that the population of the Greater Dublin Area was over 2 million, or roughly 40% of the Republic of Ireland's total population.A settlement was established in the area by the Gaels during or before the 7th century, followed by the Vikings. As the Kingdom of Dublin grew, it became Ireland's principal settlement by the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest in the British Empire and sixth largest in Western Europe after the Acts of Union in 1800. Following independence in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, renamed Ireland in 1937.
Dublin is a centre for education, arts and culture, administration and industry. As of 2018, the city was listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) as a global city, with a ranking of "Alpha minus", which places it as one of the top thirty cities in the world. <|endoftext|> The United Arab Emirates (UAE; Arabic: اَلْإِمَارَات الْعَرَبِيَة الْمُتَحِدَة al-ʾImārāt al-ʿArabīyah al-Muttaḥidah), or simply the Emirates (Arabic: الِْإمَارَات al-ʾImārāt), is a country in Western Asia (The Middle East). It is located at the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula and shares borders with Oman and Saudi Arabia, while having maritime borders in the Persian Gulf with Qatar and Iran. Abu Dhabi is the nation's capital, while Dubai, the most populous city, is an international hub.
The United Arab Emirates is an elective monarchy formed from a federation of seven emirates, consisting of Abu Dhabi (the capital), Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. Each emirate is governed by an emir and together the emirs form the Federal Supreme Council. The members of the Federal Supreme Council elect a president and vice president from among their members. In practice, the emir of Abu Dhabi serves as president while the ruler of Dubai is vice president and also prime minister. In 2013, the country had a population of 9.2 million, of which 1.4 million were Emirati citizens and 7.8 million were expatriates. As of 2020, the United Arab Emirates has an estimated population of roughly 9.9 million.The area which is today the United Arab Emirates has been inhabited for over 125,000 years. It has been the crossroads of trading for many civilizations, including Mesopotamia, Persia, and India.Islam is the official religion and Arabic  the official language. The United Arab Emirates' oil and natural gas reserves are the world's sixth and seventh-largest, respectively. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the country's first president, oversaw the development of the Emirates by investing oil revenues into healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The United Arab Emirates has the most diversified economy among the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. In the 21st century, the country has become less reliant on oil and gas and is economically focusing on tourism and business. The government does not levy income tax, although there is a corporate tax in place and a 5% value-added tax was established in 2018.Human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, Freedom House and Human Rights Watch, regard UAE as generally substandard on human rights, with citizens criticising the regime imprisoned and tortured, families harassed by the state security apparatus, and cases of forced disappearances. Individual rights such as the freedoms of assembly, association, the press, expression, and religion are also severely repressed.The UAE is considered a middle power. It is a member of the United Nations, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OPEC, Non-Aligned Movement, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). <|endoftext|> Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is home to many extremely tall modern high-rises, 108 of which stand taller than 180 metres (591 ft). The tallest building in Dubai is the Burj Khalifa, which rises 828 metres (2,717 ft) and contains 163 floors. The tower has stood as both the tallest building in the world and the tallest man-made structure of any kind in the world since its completion in January 2010. The second-tallest building in Dubai is the 425-metre (1,394 ft) Marina 101, which also stands as the world's fourth tallest residential skyscraper. The skyscrapers of Dubai are, for the most part, clustered in three different locations. The land along E 11 Road was the first to develop, followed by the Dubai Marina neighborhood and the Business Bay district.
Overall, Dubai has 18 completed and topped-out buildings that rise at least 300 metres (984 ft) in height, which is more than any other city in the world. Dubai has 73 completed and topped-out buildings that rise at least 200 metres (656 ft) in height. Based on the average height of the ten tallest completed buildings, Dubai has the tallest skyline in the Middle East and the world. As of 2012, the skyline of Dubai is ranked eighth in the world with 248 buildings rising at least 100 metres (330 ft) in height.The history of skyscrapers in Dubai began with the construction of Dubai World Trade Centre in 1979, which is usually regarded as the first high-rise in the city. At the time of its completion, it also stood as the tallest building in the Middle East. Since 1999, and especially from 2005 onwards, Dubai has been the site of an extremely large skyscraper building boom, with all 73 of its buildings over 200 metres (656 ft) tall completed after 1999. In less than ten years, the city has amassed one of the largest skylines in the world; it is now home to the world's tallest building, the world's tallest residence, and the world's second tallest hotel. As of 2019, 49 new skyscrapers are under construction in Dubai; additionally, there are over 127 active high-rise developments that have been proposed for construction in the city. <|endoftext|> Abu Dhabi (UK: , US: ; Arabic: أَبُو ظَبِي Abū Ẓabī Arabic pronunciation: [ɐˈbuˈðˤɑbi]) is the capital and second-most populous city (after Dubai) of the United Arab Emirates. It is also the capital of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the centre of the Abu Dhabi Metropolitan Area.
The city of Abu Dhabi is located on an island in the Persian Gulf, off the Central West Coast. Most of the city and the Emirate reside on the mainland connected to the rest of the country. As of 2021, Abu Dhabi's urban area had an estimated population of 1.5 million, out of 2.9 million in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, as of 2016. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is headquartered in the city, and was the world's 5th largest sovereign wealth fund in 2021. Abu Dhabi itself has over a trillion US dollars worth of assets under management in a combination of various sovereign wealth funds headquartered there.Abu Dhabi houses local and federal government offices and is the home of the United Arab Emirates Government and the Supreme Petroleum Council. The city is home to the President of the UAE, who is a member of the Al Nahyan family. Abu Dhabi's rapid development and urbanization, coupled with the massive oil and gas reserves and production and relatively high average income, have transformed it into a large, developed metropolis. It is the country's center of politics and industry, and a major culture and commerce center. Abu Dhabi accounts for about two-thirds of the roughly $503 billion UAE economy. <|endoftext|> Saudi Arabia, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is a country in Southwestern Asia. It covers the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula, and has a land area of about 2,150,000 km2 (830,000 sq mi), making it the fifth-largest country in Asia, the second-largest in the Arab world, and the largest in Western Asia and the Middle East. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the west; Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait to the north; the Persian Gulf, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to the east; Oman to the southeast; and Yemen to the south. Bahrain is an island country off the east coast. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. Its capital and largest city is Riyadh. The country is home to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest cities in Islam.
Pre-Islamic Arabia, the territory that constitutes modern-day Saudi Arabia, was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations; the prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world. The world's second-largest religion, Islam, emerged in what is now Saudi Arabia. In the early 7th century, the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabian Peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632, his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory (from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to parts of Central and South Asia in the east) in a matter of decades. Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750), Abbasid (750–1517), and Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates, as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia, Africa, and Europe.
The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of mainly four distinct historical regions: Hejaz, Najd, and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and South Arabia ('Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud in the West). He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, where political decisions are made on the basis of consultation among the King, the Council of Ministers, and the country’s traditional elites that oversee a highly authoritarian regime. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been described as a "predominant feature of Saudi culture", although the power of the religious establishment has been significantly eroded in the 2010s. In its Basic Law, Saudi Arabia continues to define itself as a sovereign Arab Islamic state with Islam as its official religion, Arabic as its official language, and Riyadh as its capital.
Petroleum was discovered in 1938 and followed up by several other finds in the Eastern Province. Saudi Arabia has since become the world's second-largest oil producer (behind the US) and the world's largest oil exporter, controlling the world's second-largest oil reserves and the fourth-largest gas reserves. The kingdom is categorized as a World Bank high-income economy and is the only Arab country to be part of the G20 major economies. The state has attracted criticism for a variety of reasons, including its role in the Yemeni Civil War, alleged sponsorship of Islamic terrorism and its poor human rights record, including the excessive and often extrajudicial use of capital punishment.Saudi Arabia is considered both a regional and middle power. The Saudi economy is the largest in the Middle East; the world's eighteenth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the seventeenth-largest by PPP. As a country with a very high Human Development Index, it offers a tuition-free university education, no personal income tax, and a free universal health care system. Saudi Arabia is home to the world's third-largest immigrant population. It also has one of the world's youngest populations, with approximately 50 per cent of its population of 34.2 million being under 25 years old. In addition to being a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia is an active and founding member of the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Arab League, Arab Air Carriers Organization and OPEC. <|endoftext|> The Burj Khalifa (; Arabic: برج خليفة, Arabic pronunciation: [bʊrd͡ʒ xaˈliːfa], Khalifa Tower), known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in 2010, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is known for being the world's tallest building. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009, supplanting Taipei 101, the previous holder of that status.Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the former East German parliament. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It was designed to be the centerpiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building was based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building is named in honor of the former president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the world.
Burj Khalifa was designed by a team led by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm that designed the Sears Tower in Chicago, a previous record holder for the world's tallest building. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation except egress stairs within each of the wings. The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.
At a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers experienced financial problems and required more money and economic funding. Sheikh Khalifa, the then-ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence the changing of the name from "Burj Dubai" to "Burj Khalifa". The concept of profitability derived from building high-density developments and malls around the landmark has proven successful. Its surrounding malls, hotels, and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit.The critical reception of Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards. However, there were numerous complaints concerning migrant workers from South Asia who were the primary building labour force. These centered on low wages and the practice of confiscating passports until duties were complete. <|endoftext|> Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is home to many extremely tall modern high-rises, 108 of which stand taller than 180 metres (591 ft).
