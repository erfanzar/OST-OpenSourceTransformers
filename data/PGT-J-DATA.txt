 Hello! I just got done reading about Stephen Colbert's explanation of God and information about Star Trek, did you read the same articles as me? Yeah, I have those articles. I think it's interesting that before 1963, students in the US read the Bible as part of the primary education.
 Are you familiar with Stephen Colbert? just a little bit of the article i just read.  How does he start out with an explanation to god with broccoli?
 Are you religious, do you read the bible? I am but I do not read the bible. Are you? do you read the bible?
 Hey how are you, what'd you think of Colbert's explanation of God? Everyone has to be so politically correct these days!! He's on TV so they monitor everything these days!!  He should be honest as say how he feels, so we all would know the truth, instead of what they have told him to say!!

 Hey there, do you vote during elections? Yes, I always vote. How about you?
 Hi! It's so insane that women couldn't vote just a short time ago. I remember my grandma telling me about that.  It is strange to think about. I think it is irresponsible not to vote in this day and age. It is a hard fought right and we should take advantage fo that. 
 It appears that our country is in a lull when it comes to being willing to vote.  I know. I think Ms. McDonald may take it really seriously but I can unserstand why. A lot of woman worked really hard for the right to vote.
 How do you like Nickelodeon?  They did get political though but celebrated and honored those participating in the March for Our Lives to address gun control and stop mass shootings. Nickelodeon ? That channel for kids ? I mean we watched it only when my kids were really young... not anymore... who else do You think watches that... ?

 Hi, Do you remember Dennis Rodman from the Bulls?  He visited Singapore for the Summit between Trump and Kim. Hello,  Yes I remember him,  he had different colored hair all the time!  Awesome.  
 I wonder how much of a voice we should give to a celebrity when it comes to foreign policy In my opinion, for the most cases none.  Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong Un for example is pretty crazy.
 How's it going? Did you know that the term "summit" wasn't used until 1955? Hi, yourself.  No I didn't know that.  I know a summit is a big deal international meeting with lots of heads of state or governments.  Usually you hear about the G20 summit.
 So, it's pretty interesting that Dennis Rodman hasn't commented on that latest Trump/Kim Jong Un Summit.  Yeah he might be feeling jealous or hurt that he was not invited.

 Do you like hockey? I'd feel pretty defeated if I was the other goalie in the 1924 Olympics who let in 132 goals. Haha. I love hockey. It's the only sport where super dramatic things like that happens. Like in 1930, when a hockey goalie caught on fire because a puck hit a pack of matches in his pocket. Like, why did he have matches in his pockets anyway?

 I recently read that some scientist theorize that universes evolve through natural selection (AKA survival of the fittest) like species on earth.  I wonder how that is possible considering universes do not have the same attributes as living creatures. Well the universe is made up of planets right.

 Hi there! How are you doing this fine Internet evening? Hi!

 Did you know the Republican Party is also referred to as the GOP (Grand Old Party)? I've heard that. It's crazy to think that there hasn't been a president who wasn't democrat or republican since 1853. Maybe time for more than two parties?

 I'm surprised to read that MLS cannot find a suitable venue for DC United to play its home opener at.  Given how much money soccer makes world wide, you would think they have a good arena for them. It makes more than every other sport combined.

 Good Morning! I'm not much interested in the White House, but I do root for President Trump So do I.  I hope he succeeds with some of his initiatives.  I wonder if he'll want to take the solar panels off the back of the white house that George Bush had installed.
 Greetings!  Hi, how are you doing?

 Are you a Linkin Park fan?  They are great. They played 324 concerts in 2001. I still can´t believe it. I am I think they are one of the best bands ever, too bad the leading singer committed suicide, maybe the toll of many concerts made him fall into depression.

 Hi!  I didn't know that there was a type of soccer where three teams play at once.  Wonder how that works? Fascinating.  I imagine the better two of the teams would just try to put it past the weakest defense.  Or maybe the scoring is different?

 An undercover detective holding his badge and shouting "police, police" was shot and killed by police in Maryland. Cat-like reflexes, trained to perform at the highest level, equipped with the finest weapons and trained to distinguish between friend and foe...did this to a fellow law enforcement professional. This is dangerous work with genuine risk. My hearts go out to all involved. Were there flame throwers involved? If this was South Africa, cars can legally be equipped with those.  Talk about deterrent!

 Hello, How are you today? Good morning; I am doing great today thank you for asking!
 Episcopal is a private boarding school in Alexandria with a lot of diversity. Yes I have heard that it is a very beautiful school. Are you familiar with David Zeng by chance?
 Hi there, do you like the NFL games Hi there I sure do. Did you know snoop dogg wrote a song for his son's school team?
 Do you know what the highest scoring football game was? No, 150-ish  ?
 Hello and good morning. You a basketball fan? I used to play a lot. I like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar he was very dominant. His dunk was crazy. Yes I am a basketball fan. I follow the NBA more than I follow college basketball. Who is your favorite team?
 There are so very odd facts about the united states government. I wonder if the same can be said for other countries.  I'm sure there is. I find it odd that every US president with a beard has been Republican. 
 Hello! Do you have a favorite football team? hi, how are you? no i dont. i dont really know the sport well. You?
 Hi!  Do you follow the government? A little the Republican party is also called the GOP.
 Hello there! Hello, do you know Paul Manafort, former Trump campain chairman
 Hi, how are you? What do you think of government? I like it but do not like some of the players. You?
 Do you consume the news a lot? Not really. I don't like all the negativity although I am guilty of getting news form social media like facebook.
 What are your thoughs on media? I think it's very important for people to stay informed and also as equally important to not be biased by what you see and that certain publications are biased vs others, what about you?
 Good morning! Are you a fan of football? Good morning. Yes. which is your favourite football team ?
 do you like the band Kiss? I like them a lot, I guess they bought into an arena football team I do enjoy their music.  I think its cool that they offered a contract to Tim Tebow to play.
 Have you heard that Trump is apparently worried over the Manafort trial? It's been in the news lately. Yeah, Paul Manafort is quite the character, as is Trump. Trump was evidently quoted saying he didn't understand why the government didn't tell him Manafort was under investigation.
 What do you think about the company Trump keeps like Paul manafort? I think it is questionable.  Obviously the problem is two-fold for Trump.  The types he associates with and when he endorses someone, that stamp of approval does not mean much.
 Hi! Are you a football fan? I watch some football on occasion.
 Hi! Do you follow the government at all? I find it awfully ironic that Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy them. Ha! I've always followed the government closely.

 Do you follow politics? Yes, I dont like Trump, how about you?

 Hello,  hows it going?  did you know the Presidents guest house is bigger than the white house?  That is crazy! I did hear that. pomp and circumstance. Apparently the president of Indonesia has 3 pop album.

 do you know much about presidents? I know some stuff. DO you know who are the three wealthiest us presidents?
 Do you get a lot of news from the media? I try to stick with larger media outlets.  I follow news aggregators, like Drudge and then for issues I am interested, I get info from different sources to weed out biases.  Media is still important but needs to report more and opine less.  I think that's the gist of the Gallup poll.  Your thoughts?
 Episcopal High School is great for learning football and bonding as a team.  It is very diverse as well. Yeah I heard it is a good school.  I guess the student population there is 445.

 The White House is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. and has been there since 1800 and I have never been.  Have you? I've never been, though I want to go.The White House seems behind the curve technologically. W. had solar panels put back on the White House. Reagan had them taken off.

 I'm from Cleveland, so I despise Bill Belichick, but not in the way that I despise the front office of the New Orleans Saints.

I've heard the pundits use the term "constitution" repeatedly; at least I have the freedom to change the channel if I want to, I guess. :) That is always good.

There are communications from a youtube video from a Chinese woman addressing her husband and saying she hasn't contacted him due to relationship issues and to stop writing.

 Hi, do you listen to the radio? Hi, how are you? dont listen much now. i did as a kid. YOu?
 Hello! Do you like football? Hi! I do like football, but mostly listen to it on the radio, how about you?

 Have you ever thought about drive-thrus?  I've heard that Mcdonalds invented the drive thru just to help out soldiers back in the day. I havent given too much thought to that but it seems interesting, kind of the aggressive mode google self driving cars have.

 Hilarious that Fox News tried to sue the Simpsons for parodying it. I suppose Ailes didn't understand the Streisand Effect, perhaps due to the fact that he's an older guy and not super familiar with the internet.  Not a huge fan of Fox News. Even more surprising that they're more watched than CNN and MSNBC combined.

 Hello! Hi there, are you a big car person?

 Have you ever seen Hope Hicks? I think she's very attractive. No, I haven't, is she an actress or a performer or something?
 Do you like Trump as president? Sure, I've also met Larry Kudlow. 
 Hey there partner. Isn't it crazy that we choose one leader to make decisions for 350 million people in our country! Yeah that is interesting. Luckily we don't automatically let the runner up in a presidential election become vice president anymore. That would be...interesting!

 Do you watch much television? Yeah, I watch some shows from time to time, you?
 Hello there, do you watch much television? I use too. I stream a lot more now due to advertisements. How about you?
 hey did you know that Trump wouldn't qualify as one of the top 3 most wealthy presidents in US history? Interesting, I suppose on an inflation adjusted basis that may be right. 
 Hi there, did you know there is a 3g internet tower at the top of Everest? wow I didn't know that, good thing people can take selfies at the top! have you ever used a hamburger button online?
 I suppose you know that there are 32 teams in the NFL? I knew there were a lot, but I don't think I knew the exact number. That makes sense though with how it's separated between the NFC and AFC
 did you know that there's a version of soccer where three teams face each other, at the same time? it's pretty cool Wild game. I would love to see that and listen to the announcers trying to keep track of everything. Do they play with more than one ball?
 I really hope Lamar Jackson does well He did pretty well in college. Winning the heisman is a big accomplishment 
 I am watching the news on television right now - do you remember when all of the tvs were black and white? I don't remember that though I do remember having one black and white tv. Interesting that before WWII the TV was not commonplace in homes.

 Hi, how are you doing this fine evening? Hi hows it going? I am good.  do you watch television?

 Do you listen to the radio? i used to listen to the radio. not so much now. you?

 Good morning, have you ever picked up any of the radio storms from Jupiter? They can be found sometimes on an AM station. I have not actually. I do know that there is a way to make a radio using a razorblade and a pencil as a diode.
 Hi there!  Do you still listen to the radio? In the car, the radio is on.  I have one here in the office.  I might turn it on. It is creepy thinking about radio waves and oscillating fields.

 I travel when I get the chance. Do you like to travel? Yes I like to travel, I've been many places.
 Hi! Do you like sports? I really like football and to be honest, I didn't really enjoy the super bowl game, but I do like the quarterback, Tom Brady. I like some sports.

 Hi! Do you like football? Yes, although the word can mean any different games.
 Did you know the visiting locker room at University of Iowa is painted pink? woah! why do you thnk that is?
 There never seems to be ANYTHING positive about Trump from the MSM.  CBS is now saying that Trump has something against babies.  This isn't journalism, it's amateur hour... I agree with you on that.  They hate him and it shows every time they open their mouth.  It's actually kind of funny to watch them.

 Its kind of crazy to think about how cars use to have wooden trunks. Now we know why their called "trunks." I didn't know that! It's surprising to see how long we've come since wooden trunks! I mean cars have rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment! I actually can't believe people would equip their cars with flame throwers!
 hi how are you? would you kidnap a goat? No, I dont think so lol, maybe if it was a famous goat like Bill the Goat
 Good evening there. Do you like dogs? I love them because they're truly man's best friend. That's nice. I'm more interested in the practical contributions they can make, like hunting and protection.

 Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques – including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".
This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals. Dublin (; Irish: Baile Átha Cliath, pronounced [ˈbˠalʲə aːhə ˈclʲiə] or [ˌbʲlʲaː ˈclʲiə]) is the capital and largest city of Ireland. On a bay at the mouth of the River Liffey, it is in the province of Leinster, bordered on the south by the Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains range. At the 2016 census it had a population of 1,173,179, while the preliminary results of the 2022 census recorded that County Dublin as a whole had a population of 1,450,701, and that the population of the Greater Dublin Area was over 2 million, or roughly 40% of the Republic of Ireland's total population.A settlement was established in the area by the Gaels during or before the 7th century, followed by the Vikings. As the Kingdom of Dublin grew, it became Ireland's principal settlement by the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest in the British Empire and sixth largest in Western Europe after the Acts of Union in 1800. Following independence in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, renamed Ireland in 1937.
Dublin is a centre for education, arts and culture, administration and industry. As of 2018, the city was listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) as a global city, with a ranking of "Alpha minus", which places it as one of the top thirty cities in the world. The United Arab Emirates (UAE; Arabic: اَلْإِمَارَات الْعَرَبِيَة الْمُتَحِدَة al-ʾImārāt al-ʿArabīyah al-Muttaḥidah), or simply the Emirates (Arabic: الِْإمَارَات al-ʾImārāt), is a country in Western Asia (The Middle East). It is located at the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula and shares borders with Oman and Saudi Arabia, while having maritime borders in the Persian Gulf with Qatar and Iran. Abu Dhabi is the nation's capital, while Dubai, the most populous city, is an international hub.
The United Arab Emirates is an elective monarchy formed from a federation of seven emirates, consisting of Abu Dhabi (the capital), Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. Each emirate is governed by an emir and together the emirs form the Federal Supreme Council. The members of the Federal Supreme Council elect a president and vice president from among their members. In practice, the emir of Abu Dhabi serves as president while the ruler of Dubai is vice president and also prime minister. In 2013, the country had a population of 9.2 million, of which 1.4 million were Emirati citizens and 7.8 million were expatriates. As of 2020, the United Arab Emirates has an estimated population of roughly 9.9 million.The area which is today the United Arab Emirates has been inhabited for over 125,000 years. It has been the crossroads of trading for many civilizations, including Mesopotamia, Persia, and India.Islam is the official religion and Arabic  the official language. The United Arab Emirates' oil and natural gas reserves are the world's sixth and seventh-largest, respectively. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the country's first president, oversaw the development of the Emirates by investing oil revenues into healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The United Arab Emirates has the most diversified economy among the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. In the 21st century, the country has become less reliant on oil and gas and is economically focusing on tourism and business. The government does not levy income tax, although there is a corporate tax in place and a 5% value-added tax was established in 2018.Human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, Freedom House and Human Rights Watch, regard UAE as generally substandard on human rights, with citizens criticising the regime imprisoned and tortured, families harassed by the state security apparatus, and cases of forced disappearances. Individual rights such as the freedoms of assembly, association, the press, expression, and religion are also severely repressed.The UAE is considered a middle power. It is a member of the United Nations, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OPEC, Non-Aligned Movement, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is home to many extremely tall modern high-rises, 108 of which stand taller than 180 metres (591 ft). The tallest building in Dubai is the Burj Khalifa, which rises 828 metres (2,717 ft) and contains 163 floors. The tower has stood as both the tallest building in the world and the tallest man-made structure of any kind in the world since its completion in January 2010. The second-tallest building in Dubai is the 425-metre (1,394 ft) Marina 101, which also stands as the world's fourth tallest residential skyscraper. The skyscrapers of Dubai are, for the most part, clustered in three different locations. The land along E 11 Road was the first to develop, followed by the Dubai Marina neighborhood and the Business Bay district.
Overall, Dubai has 18 completed and topped-out buildings that rise at least 300 metres (984 ft) in height, which is more than any other city in the world. Dubai has 73 completed and topped-out buildings that rise at least 200 metres (656 ft) in height. Based on the average height of the ten tallest completed buildings, Dubai has the tallest skyline in the Middle East and the world. As of 2012, the skyline of Dubai is ranked eighth in the world with 248 buildings rising at least 100 metres (330 ft) in height.The history of skyscrapers in Dubai began with the construction of Dubai World Trade Centre in 1979, which is usually regarded as the first high-rise in the city. At the time of its completion, it also stood as the tallest building in the Middle East. Since 1999, and especially from 2005 onwards, Dubai has been the site of an extremely large skyscraper building boom, with all 73 of its buildings over 200 metres (656 ft) tall completed after 1999. In less than ten years, the city has amassed one of the largest skylines in the world; it is now home to the world's tallest building, the world's tallest residence, and the world's second tallest hotel. As of 2019, 49 new skyscrapers are under construction in Dubai; additionally, there are over 127 active high-rise developments that have been proposed for construction in the city. Abu Dhabi (UK: , US: ; Arabic: أَبُو ظَبِي Abū Ẓabī Arabic pronunciation: [ɐˈbuˈðˤɑbi]) is the capital and second-most populous city (after Dubai) of the United Arab Emirates. It is also the capital of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the centre of the Abu Dhabi Metropolitan Area.
The city of Abu Dhabi is located on an island in the Persian Gulf, off the Central West Coast. Most of the city and the Emirate reside on the mainland connected to the rest of the country. As of 2021, Abu Dhabi's urban area had an estimated population of 1.5 million, out of 2.9 million in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, as of 2016. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is headquartered in the city, and was the world's 5th largest sovereign wealth fund in 2021. Abu Dhabi itself has over a trillion US dollars worth of assets under management in a combination of various sovereign wealth funds headquartered there.Abu Dhabi houses local and federal government offices and is the home of the United Arab Emirates Government and the Supreme Petroleum Council. The city is home to the President of the UAE, who is a member of the Al Nahyan family. Abu Dhabi's rapid development and urbanization, coupled with the massive oil and gas reserves and production and relatively high average income, have transformed it into a large, developed metropolis. It is the country's center of politics and industry, and a major culture and commerce center. Abu Dhabi accounts for about two-thirds of the roughly $503 billion UAE economy. Saudi Arabia, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is a country in Southwestern Asia. It covers the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula, and has a land area of about 2,150,000 km2 (830,000 sq mi), making it the fifth-largest country in Asia, the second-largest in the Arab world, and the largest in Western Asia and the Middle East. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the west; Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait to the north; the Persian Gulf, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to the east; Oman to the southeast; and Yemen to the south. Bahrain is an island country off the east coast. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. Its capital and largest city is Riyadh. The country is home to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest cities in Islam.
Pre-Islamic Arabia, the territory that constitutes modern-day Saudi Arabia, was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations; the prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world. The world's second-largest religion, Islam, emerged in what is now Saudi Arabia. In the early 7th century, the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabian Peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632, his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory (from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to parts of Central and South Asia in the east) in a matter of decades. Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750), Abbasid (750–1517), and Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates, as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia, Africa, and Europe.
The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of mainly four distinct historical regions: Hejaz, Najd, and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and South Arabia ('Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud in the West). He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, where political decisions are made on the basis of consultation among the King, the Council of Ministers, and the country’s traditional elites that oversee a highly authoritarian regime. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been described as a "predominant feature of Saudi culture", although the power of the religious establishment has been significantly eroded in the 2010s. In its Basic Law, Saudi Arabia continues to define itself as a sovereign Arab Islamic state with Islam as its official religion, Arabic as its official language, and Riyadh as its capital.
Petroleum was discovered in 1938 and followed up by several other finds in the Eastern Province. Saudi Arabia has since become the world's second-largest oil producer (behind the US) and the world's largest oil exporter, controlling the world's second-largest oil reserves and the fourth-largest gas reserves. The kingdom is categorized as a World Bank high-income economy and is the only Arab country to be part of the G20 major economies. The state has attracted criticism for a variety of reasons, including its role in the Yemeni Civil War, alleged sponsorship of Islamic terrorism and its poor human rights record, including the excessive and often extrajudicial use of capital punishment.Saudi Arabia is considered both a regional and middle power. The Saudi economy is the largest in the Middle East; the world's eighteenth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the seventeenth-largest by PPP. As a country with a very high Human Development Index, it offers a tuition-free university education, no personal income tax, and a free universal health care system. Saudi Arabia is home to the world's third-largest immigrant population. It also has one of the world's youngest populations, with approximately 50 per cent of its population of 34.2 million being under 25 years old. In addition to being a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia is an active and founding member of the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Arab League, Arab Air Carriers Organization and OPEC. The Burj Khalifa (; Arabic: برج خليفة, Arabic pronunciation: [bʊrd͡ʒ xaˈliːfa], Khalifa Tower), known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in 2010, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is known for being the world's tallest building. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009, supplanting Taipei 101, the previous holder of that status.Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the former East German parliament. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It was designed to be the centerpiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building was based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building is named in honor of the former president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the world.
Burj Khalifa was designed by a team led by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm that designed the Sears Tower in Chicago, a previous record holder for the world's tallest building. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation except egress stairs within each of the wings. The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.
At a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers experienced financial problems and required more money and economic funding. Sheikh Khalifa, the then-ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence the changing of the name from "Burj Dubai" to "Burj Khalifa". The concept of profitability derived from building high-density developments and malls around the landmark has proven successful. Its surrounding malls, hotels, and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit.The critical reception of Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards. However, there were numerous complaints concerning migrant workers from South Asia who were the primary building labour force. These centered on low wages and the practice of confiscating passports until duties were complete.

 What discovery in the early 1960s was the impetus for unification of the Emirates? 
Prior to the discovery of oil, one of the primary exports of the region had been pearls, an industry that had sustained the sheikhs for millennia. The advent of World War I and the development by the Japanese of cultured pearls all but destroyed the industry.
Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (1918-2004) became the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966 and was the driving force behind the unification of the emirates. With oil interests being lost to U.S. companies, the answer to that problem lay in unifying their interests and protecting their own resources from foreign control. The new constitution was put in place in 1971, forming the UAE from the former 'Trucial States.
