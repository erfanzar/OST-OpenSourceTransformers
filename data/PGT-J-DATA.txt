 <|endoftext|>  Did You know that humans may have lost their body hair as recently as 240,000 years ago ? <|endoftext|>  I think that fact is misleading.

 <|endoftext|>  Dogs or cats? <|endoftext|>  Dogs of course, you?

 <|endoftext|>  Good morning.  So, the other day I was shopping for a shirt and then I heard that originally shirts used to be an item worn exclusively by men.  How strange. <|endoftext|>  Maybe because women only wore dresses?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! ;) <|endoftext|>  Thanks and hello.
 <|endoftext|>  I don't much like winter, but at least there are no snakes outside.  Carnivorous reptiles can be dangerous if they are poisonous. <|endoftext|>  Or you can go to New Zealand where there are no snakes.  I wonder how that happened and none got there accidentally like on plane rides.

Second to earth, that is.

Neat that he was a ballet dancer.  Speaking of ballet dancers, I'm told they go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a WEEK.  Talk about being on your toes!
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that Bruce Lee was a great dancer? <|endoftext|>  No but I figure since he was so good in martial arts moves, dancing would come easy.  What is more surprising is Mr. Rogers learned to break dance on an episode.

 <|endoftext|>  Did you ever hear of Nokie Edwards of the Ventures?  He helped create hits in the 60's? <|endoftext|>  I have not ever heard of him. What type of music did he/they play?
 <|endoftext|>  "Reality show" is a good description for Bezos's search for a new headquarters location. LOL. <|endoftext|>  The Amazon guy? Yeah, reality show sounds about right based on the jokes I read on Twitter!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi do you shop online much? <|endoftext|>  I do actually I do a lot of shopping on Amazon, and you?
 <|endoftext|>  William Shakespeare was a master writer; I would argue that the world will never see another like him. <|endoftext|>  I agree with you.  I heard he might have actually been a woman, or,  a group of people.  Did you know he is credited with inventing the names Miranda, Jessica and Olivia?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi. Do you like Shakespeare? <|endoftext|>  Hello!  Yes I do.  He is regarded as the greatest writer in the English language.  Are you a fan?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, have you listened to any good albums lately? <|endoftext|>  I have to say that I have not unfortunately.  I haven't even listened to anything on vinyl.  Have you?

 <|endoftext|>  HI, have you read Macbeth? I read it and is very interesting <|endoftext|>  I have! Lady Macbeth was always my favorite character but now I'm leaning towards Lady Macduff. A revival of the play about ~350 years ago gave her a bigger role and she's actually heroic, not murderous lol
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning. Have you watched the Ethiopian celebrity chef? He's awesome. <|endoftext|>  I have. The way he is trying to combat hunger in his country is just awe inspiring.

 <|endoftext|>  The sun is a pretty crazy thing, what do you think? <|endoftext|>  It really is. Did you know that the sun is actually white. It just looks yellow because of atmospheric scattering.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you like soccer? <|endoftext|>  I do enjoy soccer, have done all my life but I don't get to see much now.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Hello there, I am well thank you.  How are you today?
 <|endoftext|>  Morning! Wow, I haven't thought about sports since high school. I didn't realize competitive wrestling really is. <|endoftext|>  Apparently its as competitive as other sports, I just to wrestle in high school so it would be nice to remember those times.
 <|endoftext|>  I have a love/hate relationship with running, but I can appreciate people who can do it and do it well like Donald Ritchie <|endoftext|>  Same here, I have run one marathon and never plan to again, I couldnt imagine being an ultra runner
 <|endoftext|>  Donald Ritchie just died - man he was amazing at running long distances <|endoftext|>  He was. He set many world records!
 <|endoftext|>  Do you Run? <|endoftext|>  No, I don't.  Do you?
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning!! I learned a little interesting trivia... Denis Cyplenkov has the biggest and most dense muscles in the whole world!! He's an arm wresting champion... go figure!! <|endoftext|>  Wow!  His hands must be intense!!  I don't know a lot about wrestling, but it's pretty funny that the Turkish national sport is oil wrestling!
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about Morgan Freeman? I always thought he was a good guy but it seems like he's being accused of sexual harassment <|endoftext|>  Yeah, I was also disappointed when Cosby first got accused because I watched his show growing up. A lot of women have come forward and there were lots of witnesses too.
 <|endoftext|>  I have always been a fan of comedy. How about you? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I do like comedy but horror movies are my favorite.  What is your favorite movie?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy reading? <|endoftext|>  It's actually one of my favorite pastimes. I definitely would have been part of the "Moral Panic" had I lived in the 18th century, because I love novels
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there, do you watch movies at al? <|endoftext|>  I do, my favorite genre is comedy, do you like movies?

 <|endoftext|>  Are you comfortable talking about the election and voting? <|endoftext|>  ya we can do that, did you hear that a chimp literally got like 400k votes back in 1988 for mayor?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like Nintendo? <|endoftext|>  I do like Nintendo. Do you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! I just got done reading about Stephen Colbert's explanation of God and information about Star Trek, did you read the same articles as me? <|endoftext|>  Yeah, I have those articles. I think it's interesting that before 1963, students in the US read the Bible as part of the primary education.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you familiar with Stephen Colbert? <|endoftext|>  just a little bit of the article i just read.  How does he start out with an explanation to god with broccoli?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you religious, do you read the bible? <|endoftext|>  I am but I do not read the bible. Are you? do you read the bible?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how are you, what'd you think of Colbert's explanation of God? <|endoftext|>  Everyone has to be so politically correct these days!! He's on TV so they monitor everything these days!!  He should be honest as say how he feels, so we all would know the truth, instead of what they have told him to say!!
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, do you like soundtracks, they are released with movies, books, and tv shows <|endoftext|>  I like some soundtracks but only whe they are catchy songs. Alicia Keys was on the Men in Black soundtrack and wrote her own song for it, at age 16

 <|endoftext|>  What forms of entertainment do you enjoy? <|endoftext|>  I breed chickens. Just kidding. I enjoy movies, radio, and music. A good movie soundtrack really hits the spot!  What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there! <|endoftext|>  Hello. Have you ever heard of Reddit?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that Facebook and Twitter work together on some issues?  They are actually competitors. <|endoftext|>  No, I didn't know that. What kind of issues do they work together on?
 <|endoftext|>  Oh man I am low on dragon energy.  You? <|endoftext|>  Here too.  Maybe we should both eat a few big macs!!
 <|endoftext|>  Do you use facebook? <|endoftext|>  Yea but I don't like how facebook is being used for surveillance like with the company that would look at babysitters' facebook profiles

 <|endoftext|>  Hey there, do you vote during elections? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I always vote. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! It's so insane that women couldn't vote just a short time ago. I remember my grandma telling me about that.  <|endoftext|>  It is strange to think about. I think it is irresponsible not to vote in this day and age. It is a hard fought right and we should take advantage fo that. 
 <|endoftext|>  It appears that our country is in a lull when it comes to being willing to vote.  <|endoftext|>  I know. I think Ms. McDonald may take it really seriously but I can unserstand why. A lot of woman worked really hard for the right to vote.
 <|endoftext|>  How do you like Nickelodeon?  They did get political though but celebrated and honored those participating in the March for Our Lives to address gun control and stop mass shootings. <|endoftext|>  Nickelodeon ? That channel for kids ? I mean we watched it only when my kids were really young... not anymore... who else do You think watches that... ?

 <|endoftext|>  Have you seen the tv show Stranger Things?  It is quite the interesting horrow show <|endoftext|>  I havnt. Is it any good.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there! How are you today? I've been watching TV. <|endoftext|>  Hey oh nice me too! What are your thoughts on politics in Hollywood? I think it is ridiculous! Event the kids choice awards are getting involved!

 <|endoftext|>  I wonder how much of a voice we should give to a celebrity when it comes to foreign policy <|endoftext|>  In my opinion, for the most cases none.  Dennis Rodman and Kim Jong Un for example is pretty crazy.
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going? Did you know that the term "summit" wasn't used until 1955? <|endoftext|>  Hi, yourself.  No I didn't know that.  I know a summit is a big deal international meeting with lots of heads of state or governments.  Usually you hear about the G20 summit.
 <|endoftext|>  So, it's pretty interesting that Dennis Rodman hasn't commented on that latest Trump/Kim Jong Un Summit.  <|endoftext|>  Yeah he might be feeling jealous or hurt that he was not invited.

 <|endoftext|>  Do you like hockey? I'd feel pretty defeated if I was the other goalie in the 1924 Olympics who let in 132 goals. <|endoftext|>  Haha. I love hockey. It's the only sport where super dramatic things like that happens. Like in 1930, when a hockey goalie caught on fire because a puck hit a pack of matches in his pocket. Like, why did he have matches in his pockets anyway?

 <|endoftext|>  I recently read that some scientist theorize that universes evolve through natural selection (AKA survival of the fittest) like species on earth.  I wonder how that is possible considering universes do not have the same attributes as living creatures. <|endoftext|>  Well the universe is made up of planets right. So the bigger planets suck the smaller ones in and consume them.
 <|endoftext|>  I like Bill Murray but I can't agree that Kung Fu Hustle is the supreme achievement of modern comedy. <|endoftext|>  Is Kung Fu Hustle a movie? If so, I've never seen it.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Have you seen Justice League yet? If you have and didn't like it, don't bother buying it on 4k. Otherwise it's just two hours of "Oh what could have been ". DC and Warner Bros really missed a huge opportunity travel a mark on the world of superhero cinema! <|endoftext|>  I havent, but it seems like a great movie, DC and Warner Bros make a great combination, 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to read?  I enjoy Stephen King books.  My first question would be to definitely ask him what I should be reading.

I was also shocked to hear that they renamed Frozen and Tangled to avoid "feminine" titles. How stupid is that?

 <|endoftext|>  Hello - did you know a man was falsely imprisoned for 10 years and spent most of his time at the library to prove his innocence?  <|endoftext|>  I was not aware of that! That is interesting! Much cheaper than having to buy a lawyer! I do know there are more libraries than there are McDonald's in the US and that's a huge plus considering libraries are much more beneficial to us than Mickey D's!

 <|endoftext|>  Do you like animals? I love them. I have dogs, but I also love horses. I love that my dogs can understand where I point. Evidently only dogs and elephants are the only animals that can understand a human's point.  <|endoftext|>  I do. I love horses. Especially the Lipizzaner, it takes them 6 years to turn white.

Considering how tall he is, I think he was a center

 <|endoftext|>  Swimming is a very interesting sport. It's awesome that Sean Conway Jr. got so many all-American times in 2018. What about you? <|endoftext|>  Swimming is a great sport. Not only do you get great exercise, but because you are in water, the stress on your body is lowered

 <|endoftext|>  Hello, I recently found out that a seahorse is the only fish to have a neck. I never thought of that before, have you? <|endoftext|>  I guess the other types don't need one. I don't think jellyfish even have bones, and there's one species that's believed to be immortal

 <|endoftext|>  Do you like rap? <|endoftext|>  Not really, I used to listen to Eminem though, did you know he wanted to be a comic book artist?

Did you know there is breed of jellyfish that is immortal? <|endoftext|>  Actually I do, I read about that jellyfish, when it sense danger it regresses in age and becomes a child, grows until more danger, regresses, really crazy. How about hanako the koi who lived for 226 years. He outlived 4-5 generations of that family.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! <|endoftext|>  Same here. I was not aware that Myspace passed on the opportunity to buy facebook. That was not a smart decision.

 <|endoftext|>  Hello, sis you know Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago?   <|endoftext|>  I did. It is also covered in a majority of water too
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning! How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Hey! Doing well thanks how are you? Have you ever heard of or used Rotten Tomatoes, the site that rates movies and TV?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi. Do you like entertainment? Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience or gives pleasure and delight. <|endoftext|>  Sure, who doesn't like entertainment?  I especially like the NFL which is considered entertainment rather than sport by legal definition.
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think of a muppet murder mystery? <|endoftext|>  I didnt really like it, I like how Melissa McCarthy acts but her movies are just terrible, what about you?

 <|endoftext|>  Do you use Rotten Tomatoes to get your film ratings? <|endoftext|>  I occasionally have used it! What about yourself. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I'm really good. I just finished a game of Monopoly. Did you know that the orange properties are statistically the best purchase?
 <|endoftext|>  do you like comedy films? <|endoftext|>  I love and watch them a lot and you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like Comedies?  <|endoftext|>  Of course!  Especially when ther are exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect!  How about you?

I can't imagine leaving Harvard for comedy, can you? <|endoftext|>  No, but I guess he felt his calling. Ryan Stiles did something similar. He dropped out of high school too.
 <|endoftext|>  Which do you prefer, comedies or horror films? <|endoftext|>  well I like comedies myself, can't say I'm a huge fan of horror movies I don't find them scary, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there, do you listen to music? <|endoftext|>  Sure do, doesn't everyone? What genre do you like?

 <|endoftext|>  Sometimes I wonder if these celebrities use their big multi million companies and purchases for money laundering, which is I guess why Jay-Z might be being investigated. <|endoftext|>   I find it weird though that they are trying to get information out of him with for something that no longer is under his control. Also, it is strange that he doesn't want to comply. Currently I do believe that it is the responsibility of the Iconix spokesperson to get his stuff worked out. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you today? Do you like dogs? <|endoftext|>  Hello
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there. You like Jay Z? No doubt he has done a lot as a songwriter, rapper, business man, and record producer! <|endoftext|>  I dont really know much about Jay-Z. can you tell me about him?

 <|endoftext|>  did you know that Jeff Bezos made a clock in a mountain? Like why did he do that that seems weird and a waste of money <|endoftext|>  Well I am sure he has plenty of cash to spare given that Amazon is the largest internet retailer in the world by revenue and market cap
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Hi! I am well.I was just shopping on Amazon. Hard to believe it was founded 7-5-1994.

 <|endoftext|>  Did you know government officials in ancient Athens were appointed by a lottery? <|endoftext|>  I seem to remember something about that. It was supposed to prevent tyranny.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you vote in the recent elections? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I voted, did you? I know that Trump is a Republican.
 <|endoftext|>  Our government is pretty crazy.  In 2006 we passed legislation that would protect our employees from bring prosecuted for violating the geneva convention <|endoftext|>  That is kind of a neat thing.  
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Do you like to read? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I used to be an avid reader.  Internet kind of changed that. I recently learned that Ender's Game was suggested reading for the military. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you like reading? <|endoftext|>  I do but mostly i listen to audibles. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Funny how reading is so important today when perhaps in the past people survived without it <|endoftext|>  Yes people in the past survived without it, but there were also far less intelligent people because of it.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you like to dance? <|endoftext|>  I like to watch other people dance
 <|endoftext|>  Do you think there are many books about diversity for children?   <|endoftext|>  While I agree that there is a lack of diversity in children's books, I also don't believe there is a necessity to force diversity. I support the nature development of diversity such as the The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a collector? I just read that politician Jim Graham pasted away and had an unbelievable collection. . . <|endoftext|>  I am a collector of dollars but nothing tangible. I can't believe how much he had!
 <|endoftext|>  Hey! Do you know that New York area code 212 because it was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone? <|endoftext|>  No, I had no idea. I've only used a rotary phone a couple times when I was kid but I wonder why 111 wouldn't be quicker than 212

 <|endoftext|>  So I guess involuntary pornography like face swapping celebrity faces onto pornographic material is being banned.  <|endoftext|>  From Reddit anyway - the deep-fake celebrity variety.  I think the rest of their porn is up and running.

Also,  why didn't our teachers tell us this in elementary school,  everyone draws a yellow sun! lol  <|endoftext|>  Ha, that is funny! I can't believe that the sun is only 1 billionth the size of the biggest star discovered in our galaxy!

 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you a sports fan? <|endoftext|>  Not the biggest one TBH, but I do find some of the facts and details behind certain sports to be fascinating.  What about yourself?
 <|endoftext|>  Wheaton Hills sounds like a nice community. I hope that kind of genuine community will be coming back because of Peak Oil and relocalization. <|endoftext|>  Yeah seems nice. Do you like basketball?
 <|endoftext|>  Another shooting at Walmart....so sad to see these things happening <|endoftext|>  Yes, it is sad to hear about these things.  Do you think the world is getting worse or we are able to see it easier now that cameras are everywhere and the internet it available to all.

 <|endoftext|>  So do you like soccer? <|endoftext|>  I enjoy watching soccer when it's country versus country like the World Cup. I have not gotten into individual leagues as much.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how are you? You know who Kelly Towles is by chance? <|endoftext|>  Hi!  I'm good.  I'm afraid I'm not familiar with her.  Where would I know her from?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello do you follow soccer? <|endoftext|>  Hi there, yeah I sure do, mostly the english league though.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there have you ever seen the show The Walking Dead before? <|endoftext|>  I used to watch it religiously and then I lost interest as the plots repeated ad infinitum.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you how much about Physics? <|endoftext|>  i do not at all! what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, are you a Walking Dead fan? My wife is beyond fan to fanatic on that show (I have tepid interest). Rick or any main characters death sends he into depression and anxiety. <|endoftext|>  I watched a few of the first episodes.  I enjoyed the interactions among the humans, but having a mindless villain was not very interesting to me.  It appears to be losing viewers.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello - how are you? <|endoftext|>  Fine. What about you ? Most of the countries want to lift the trophy of FIFA.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  Are you a soccer fan? <|endoftext|>  Never really watched it to much. Its not nearly as popular here as it is around the world.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you into FIFA World Cup soccer?   <|endoftext|>  Hi there, yes I watch the World Cup. Do you know where it will take place in 2022?
 <|endoftext|>  i had no idea that soccer is played by over 250 million players in over 200 countries.  <|endoftext|>  neither did I. its the biggest sport in the world
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there. What are your thoughts on VAR (video assistant referree) getting involved with sports like the world cup? <|endoftext|>  It sounds like it is going to be used for everything!
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, do you play many video games? <|endoftext|>  No not too many. My kids certainly do! How bout you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like soccer? <|endoftext|>  I'm not usually a fan, but I do like the watching The World Cup. I'm not liking the Video Assistant Referees though!
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there! Did you know that Bill Nye "the science guy" got his starts in entertainment by winning a Steve Martin look-alike contest? Haha! I don't even think they look at all like each other! <|endoftext|>  I don't think they look alike either! And Ronald Reagan was rejected for a movie role because he supposedly didn't have the presidential look.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Do you like dogs? <|endoftext|>  I do, I consider myself a dog person, do you like them?
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, do you like fish? I never knew that the term "fish" wasn't a formal taxonomic grouping <|endoftext|>  Wow! I didn't either and yes I do love fish! Something else surprising about fish is a goldfish once lived to be 43 years old. Can you believe that?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, are you ready to chat? <|endoftext|>  I am! Are you any good at physics? It's crazy that just the hair in "Brave" took 3 years of studying to get correct.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you today?  Hard to believe modern human behavior started around 50,000 years ago!! <|endoftext|>  I am great! How are you? We are not that old. We've been around a blink of an eye in terms of the planet. Are you characterized by erect posture and bipedal locomotion; high manual dexterity and heavy tool use? I sure am! 
 <|endoftext|>  I think electricity is the civilizing force of our world. <|endoftext|>  I too find electricity interesting. I was sad to hear of the death of Frances L. Lloyd, she was a scientist who helped come up with the concept of the volt.
 <|endoftext|>  What entertainment do you enjoy? <|endoftext|>  I like video games and sports. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Do you ever watch soccer? <|endoftext|>  You mean football!! Yes I love it.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like football? <|endoftext|>  I'm a casual fan. I tend to only follow football during the World Cup, how about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello.  Apparently New York's area code (212) was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone. <|endoftext|>  Hi, I have heard that, but it's been so long since I've seen a rotary phone I'm not really sure it's true. It's like how they say you can't separate 2 phonebooks if you overlap them together. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi , do you like to travel? <|endoftext|>  I do. I don't do it often enough but I really love going to new places. Did you know that instead of fetching baggage faster, airports just make you walk longer. It helps to stop the complaints.
 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you use the telephone much? <|endoftext|>  Not as much as my cell phone but occasional my phone doesn't have service and I will. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|>  I'm great! Thanks! How are you? I was just reading about a chemical irritant in onion that burns people's eyes. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Do you ever cry when chopping onions for your dinner? <|endoftext|>  No, I am a fish. Please help me! I am trapped in the airport bathroom in terminal B. Please come quickly, I fear someone will flush soon!
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you know much about the internet? <|endoftext|>  The internet  is the global system which connect all person in any part of the world.
 <|endoftext|>  I just recently heard about a tearless onion variety called "Sunions".  Have you? <|endoftext|>  No, I have not. Tearless onions? I guess that must be an important advancement for mankind. Who created them?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I'm great! Hi, how are you?
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you use your phone much? <|endoftext|>  All the time.  Usually not as a phone though, ironically enough.
 <|endoftext|>  What do you do for entertainment? <|endoftext|>  I enjoy bird watching, and gathering information on the bird species.

 <|endoftext|>  Hey there do you like any dramas? Like on TV or in the movies? <|endoftext|>  I do like some Drama shows, does the office count as Drama? Ellie Kemper took drama classes in high school
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, do you follow baseball at all? <|endoftext|>  I know a little bit, I usually watch around tournament times.  I know it is so popular in Japan they were surprised America claimed it as their pastime.
 <|endoftext|>  I love this time of year.  Baseball is just around the corner.  Are you a baseball fan? <|endoftext|>  I LOVE baseball!! Did you know the reason baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises. I think that would be a sight to see!
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like drama? <|endoftext|>  I love it. Do you ever watch House MD?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you this evening? <|endoftext|>  Ok. I got a lotta drama going on.  Perhaps not drama at the level of Aristotle's Poetics, but drama noetheless
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you doing? <|endoftext|>  Good.  Hope you are doing well too.  Just received a call from NY area code 212.  Did you know that was the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone?
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you enjoy reading? <|endoftext|>  I do, do you read much?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Do you like dogs? <|endoftext|>  Yes. wolves, too - from a distance! They are related carnivores - the 1st species to be domesticated, I believe.
 <|endoftext|>  hey, how are you <|endoftext|>  Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You !
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Good! How are you? Did you know animals are considered multicllular eukaryotic organisms?
 <|endoftext|>  hey there do you like animals? whats your favorite? <|endoftext|>  Hi, I am a huge fan of dogs!  I am like Google, I strongly prefer dogs over cats.  It is interesting that their code of conduct explicitly says they are a dog company!
 <|endoftext|>  Hello!  Do you listen to jazz? <|endoftext|>  Not much honestly, there's always so much going on. They say it can make you smarter though
 <|endoftext|>  Hi.  I heard recently that there is a sound frequency that automatically causes fear in humans.  Isn't that odd? <|endoftext|>  That is very odd, I wonder if militaries around the world use it someway. 
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that Hugh laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama, earning $700,000 per episode in house <|endoftext|>  Interesting factoid. I remember that show. I think he probably deserved it because it was a really good show. Too bad it's now around anymore. You also see less of Jim Carrey nowadays, I was thinking. Remember him?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello!  Do you like watching dramas? <|endoftext|>  I do watch some here and there.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like jazz? <|endoftext|>  Yes, Jazz is seen by many as Americas classical music.

 <|endoftext|>  If only I were in DC, I'd have twelve things to do.  I'll have to make a note for next time I'm there. <|endoftext|>  Looks like they have a lot of fun there. There's a Winter Olympic celebration where you're supposed to wear Olympic sports gear or ski attire.
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about Pluto not being a Planet? To me it seems kind of disrespectful.  <|endoftext|>  I think it does too. I will always think of Pluto as a planet.  There's a lot of odd things with planets. Uranus rotates on it's side so should that mean it's not a planet?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there! Do you like Star Wars? <|endoftext|>  Hi! I don't though I do have respect for it. It's the second highest grossing film series of all time.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a big fan of watching basketball? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I am. I'm Lakers fan from my childhood. And you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how's it going. Are you a big dancer? It could be expensive because professional ballet dancers go through up to four pairs of shoes in a week. <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? I am a terrible dancer! not terrific, terrible!
 <|endoftext|>  Did you see Draymond Greens shirt after the NBA finals last year. He seems to like to ruffle feathers and talk smack. <|endoftext|>  Yeah I think I remember seeing that, he has been at the center of some questionable stuff recently. 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to use Google as your search engine? It's always been my favorite! <|endoftext|>  Yes, Google all the way. Google is not only involved in search engines but in advertising technologies, cloud computing, software and hardware, too. 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to travel much? <|endoftext|>  I do when I can. What is your favorite mode of travel? Would you go on a commuter bus that is designed to travel at 160 mph?
 <|endoftext|>  I am reading a great new book called The Last Cruise.  Have you read it? <|endoftext|>  no I haven't, what is it about? someone's last cruise vacation? haha

 <|endoftext|>  Hey there! Can you believe that Judge Judy makes $123,000 per episode? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I wish I had her job. Yes, that makes her the highest paid celebrity only after Lebron James.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you have a Facebook account? <|endoftext|>  Of course. More people have facebook accounts then the worlds population as recently as 200 years ago! Almost everyone uses it.
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning!! Its extremely cold this morning!!The stars are warming up for the MLB All-star Sunday game!!! I hope it warms up by then!! <|endoftext|>  Good morning! Yes it is very cold!  I've heard that Bill Nye and Jamie Foxx among others will be at the game.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like baseball?  <|endoftext|>  I don't mind watching it but I'm not real knowledgable about it. Do you enjoy it?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you listen to jazz music? <|endoftext|>  I do I love Jazz how about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you like comedy films? <|endoftext|>  I do! I love bromantic comedies, that's a real genre! Harold and Kumar is an example. Do you like comedy films?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that Soccer makes more than all the big US sports (NFL, MLB) does combined? <|endoftext|>  Yes. Soccer makes more money than other sports. It was played in over 200 countries.

 <|endoftext|>  I've never been mattress shopping, but there's a new company that's opening a store and offering complimentary naps. I think that's a good way to ensure customer satisfaction <|endoftext|>  Best way to experience the product is to take it for a test drive. It's on Broadway. That's probably a pretty nice part of Manhattan.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like drama shows and movies? <|endoftext|>  Sure! I enjoy both dramas and comedies. What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know much about computers? <|endoftext|>  An average amount, I suppose. How about you?

 <|endoftext|>  I have recently become a soccer fan.  I never liked it growing up, but I have gained a new appreciation for it.  Do you follow the sport at all? <|endoftext|>  As a matter of fact I am quite a fan of soccer, what do you follow?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello!  Are you a soccer fan? <|endoftext|>  No, not really. I travel to Europe  for work a few times a year so I've gone to some matches and had a lot of fun, but I haven't really gotten into the sport itself over there or here in the US (I've never attended a match here).
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Do you like basketball? <|endoftext|>  Do you like soccer?

 <|endoftext|>  Hello! Do you like to read? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I love to read.  I am always read a book.  I am lucky to not be in the 18th century, when there was a moral panic over reading!
 <|endoftext|>  I have had a Netflix account forever. Do you use Netflix? <|endoftext|>  I love netflix.  I dont know what I would do without it!
 <|endoftext|>  I had no idea that from 9pm to 12am, netflix accounts for 33% of all bandwidth in north america. <|endoftext|>  That makes sense,  everyone is home lol Netflix has a movie that is nothing but an hour long video of a fireplace - fireplace for your home
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Hello, did you know that disney recycles a lot of their animation frames, that results in identical scenes in some movies.

 <|endoftext|>  What is your favorite form of entertainment ? <|endoftext|>  I pretty much like all forms but if I had to choose a favorite, I'd say comedy. In fact, I love to watch comedy central but I really hate they've cancelled over 100 shows since the network started back in 89. What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  I just got done watching the Incredibles 2, have you seen it? <|endoftext|>  Oh nice. No I have only seen the first one. Looks good though, I think Brad Bird is a good director!

 <|endoftext|>  Did you watch The Incredibles 2? <|endoftext|>  No, I haven't seen it. Looks interesting though. The present day events of the Incredibles are set in the 1960s. That's a great period for clothing and architecture.

 <|endoftext|>  Hey - have you ever seen the Incredibles 2? <|endoftext|>  You know, I have not--I haven't seen an animated movie in ages. It seems like there was an awfully long time between the original and the sequel; I believe it was 14 years. Was it good?

 <|endoftext|>  Hello,I was just thinking about the NBA and its players.Have you heard of Kevin Durant? <|endoftext|>  Yeah, he's a great player I've heard he's a bit of a hothead though
 <|endoftext|>  Hey! So are you into Basketball, I am a LEBRON fan! <|endoftext|>  Oh, cool. I am too. Yeah, basketball is great. I like the NBA mostly. 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you use amazon ? <|endoftext|>  I do because I live in the middle of nowhere, but I feel guilty about it because of the crappy way they treat their workers. Do you?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you into celebrities? I'm not a big fan of celebrity culture. <|endoftext|>  I think it's harder than it looks to be famous. There are some who don't deserve it. I know Judge Judy makes a ton of money on her show!
 <|endoftext|>  Hello.  Do you shop at Amazon? <|endoftext|>  I do, one of my favorite stores, do you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey you a fan of celebrities? I think it's funny thinking about them. So wealthy! <|endoftext|>  Yes, it's pretty outrageous to think about how much they get paid for just existing in some instances; some aren't even talented! Paris Hilton was actually in the Guinness Book of World Records for "most overrated celebrity"
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Im great! how are you?
 <|endoftext|>  do you use facebook much? <|endoftext|>  I do actually, did you ever use myspace?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Do you use Facebook? <|endoftext|>  Hi! I do use Facebook. In fact, I'm one of the 2.2 billion active users each month as of January of 2018. Ha! What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello how are you. <|endoftext|>  Well, thanks, but tired of being targeted by scammers, who prey on people my age!
 <|endoftext|>  Do you use Facebook much? <|endoftext|>  I used to but I am trying to limit it. I would delete it altogther but I need it for work. Do you use it much?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, How are you? Do you shop at Amazon? <|endoftext|>  3 times a week. I would love to see if that clock last for 10000 years
 <|endoftext|>  hello, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Hello. I'm good. Did you know that Facebook is blue because Zuckerberg is red-green colorblind? Pretty interesting.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you use Facebook? <|endoftext|>  I used to, I stopped about 5 years ago. Hard to believe its been 14 years since it was launched.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey do you use google much?  <|endoftext|>  Yes!  I use it to look up a lot of stuff. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you familiar with what a prime minister is?  <|endoftext|>  Yes, kind of like a president in parliamentary systems
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|>  Ok, how about you?  Just listening to President Trump speak about the wall and the budget funding deal.  The Democratic Party (one of the two major parties) will surely not back this.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you listen to the radio much? <|endoftext|>  Hello, I do actually. I haven't had any luck finding an am station that's pickup up the storms from Jupiter, though.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you watch a lot of basketball? <|endoftext|>  I dont. i do like basketball though. it is a fun sport.
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? what do you think about tom hanks? <|endoftext|>  I love tom hanks. Do you like him?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy piano music?  I love to listen.  Did you know that in 1930 one day there was no news that was worthy of reporting so they broadcast piano music <|endoftext|>  I do love listening to jazz. Boy, what a nice day that would be-no bad news, just piano music!
 <|endoftext|>  Would you vote if you had to walk through tiger-infested forests on the way as occurs in india? <|endoftext|>  No, Do you like Tom Hanks?
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? do you like sports? <|endoftext|>  I do like sports yeah, swimming is one of my favorite ones. 
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a piano fan? <|endoftext|>  Hey there!  I have never known how to play piano, but I have always been fascinated.  Must be something to it if it is till around after 300+ years!
 <|endoftext|>  hey did you know that baseball managers can actually play for their teams if necessary? <|endoftext|>  That's why they wear uniforms?
 <|endoftext|>  Have you noticed that Tom Hanks is never a bad guy in his films? Apparently he refuses to play the villain role. <|endoftext|>  I actually never noticed that but come to think of it, I can't recall him ever playing a bad guy. I suppose when you're the highest ranked box office star of all time, you can play whatever role you want!
 <|endoftext|>  I was surprised to learn the piano was invented in 1700. For some reason I thought it was way earlier than that! <|endoftext|>  I was surprised too. They say the piano wasinvented in 1700 but the year is uncertain.
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? do you like sports? <|endoftext|>  I do, any favorite sports?

 <|endoftext|>  Helo do you like SHakespeare's work? <|endoftext|>  I love his work actually. He even popularized many words and phrases we use today
 <|endoftext|>  Do you have any interest in Shakespeare? I took a college course on his works a few years ago <|endoftext|>  He's that fellow that wrote all them plays. No, I don't know much about him.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you into social media, like Facebook? <|endoftext|>  All the time my friend, you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi are you a fan of Netflix? <|endoftext|>  Don't subscribe regularly, but admire company's 2007 business decision to introduce streaming media. Smart move?

 <|endoftext|>  do you like the guitar? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do. DId you know Van Halen once played it so much that is set the speakers on fire?
 <|endoftext|>  You ever seen the Hotel Transylvania series?  It's not too bad, it's about a vampire that runs a hotel for monsters and his daughter falls in love with a human, and all kinds of wackiness ensues.  Adam Sandler does the voice of Dracula. <|endoftext|>  Good Afternoon!  I've seen all of them - my kids love the series and I thought they were pretty good too!  Great voice cast 
 <|endoftext|>  Ever been to Washington D.C.? <|endoftext|>  hey I have been there, it was a long time ago, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello. Did you know that over 80% of the land in Nevada is owned by the federal government? <|endoftext|>  I have read that somewhere once before.  Dont know how true it is.  Governments around the world do crazy things.  The CHINESE GOVERNMENT actually censored the word censorship!  how nuts is that?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you doing tonight? Ready for a chat? <|endoftext|>  Hey there yes I am, what do you think about our current government? Isn't it scary that they tried to destroy WikiLeaks
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Did you follow politics? <|endoftext|>  Hello there, I do follow, but not super closely, how about you?
 <|endoftext|>  So, been reading about Netflix, man wish I had that service again, had it YEARs ago when it was DVDs.. <|endoftext|>  Well they have totally changed the way we watch movies and the good thing is everyone is on it except you :)
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? do you use netflix? <|endoftext|>  I do in fact use Netflix. Do you happen to know who the founders of Netflix were?

 <|endoftext|>  Aren't you gald the mid terms are over? <|endoftext|>  Very I find the ancient athenians idea of elections intriguing. Seems like they were on to something. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there do you ever use Facebook? I used to use it a lot but not really anymore <|endoftext|>  I used to a lot more but I still do! I liked it when they did promotions, like Burger King used to give you a free whopper for unfriending 10 people. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how are you, did you watch 13 Reasons Why by chance? <|endoftext|>  I did, I loved that series kind of dark but great. Did you watch 13 Reasons Why

 <|endoftext|>  Does the fluctuations in the stock market over the past couple of months give you heart attacks? <|endoftext|>  It doesn't make me feel great. I will tell you that. I heard that the sell-off probably isn't over yet...could get worse!

 <|endoftext|>  do you use the internet a lot? <|endoftext|>  I sure do. Do you know what the hamburger button is?
 <|endoftext|>  I don't understand why it took people who are sexually assaulted so long to get the support they deserve. <|endoftext|>  I agree. We need to suppport them more.
 <|endoftext|>  Howdy - do you know much about the internet? <|endoftext|>  Yes. It is a global system of interconnected computers that use TCP IP to link devices worldwide.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi there, do you like to travel? <|endoftext|>  Oh yes. I love to travel. How about you.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you travel a lot? <|endoftext|>  Not as much as I'd like. I'd like to go to Japan but I guess I wouldn't travel by land as the tolls alone would be $300 to travel across the country.
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going? Did you know amazon was founded all the way back in 1994? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I've heard that. The first customer they had spent only $27.95.

 <|endoftext|>  The fact that Amazon workers walk 7-15 miles a shift is one of the most damning things I've heard about them. <|endoftext|>  As a company Amazon has a come a long way as a online bookstore to the largest online retailer it is now. However, you don't hear many good things about worker conditions for amazon
 <|endoftext|>  Hello!  Don't you love Amazon?  I can't believe Amazon has grown so much.  The first Amazon customer spent $27.95 and got a building named after him.   <|endoftext|>  That is pretty cool. I am surprised that Amazon workers walk between 7 and 15 miles each day as part of their shift. I always wondered what a processing plant looked like.
 <|endoftext|>  do you shop online? <|endoftext|>  Yes and my favorite store is amazon, and you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know who Jeff Bezos is?  <|endoftext|>  Ah yes, is that the Amazon guy? I heard about his clock being built into the side of a mountain and I am quite jealous!

 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, your thoughts on Ed Sheeran?  I think he has a pretty good voice. <|endoftext|>  I know he is a singer/writer but I'm unfamiliar with his work. I know he thinks Eminem is his biggest musical influence.

 <|endoftext|>  Do you use the internet a lot? <|endoftext|>  I don't think there is anyone in a first-world country that doesn't. Even the library of Alexandria has a saved copy of it.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how are you doing, ever use the internet for stuff besides turkin it? <|endoftext|>  Oh yeah.  I look up stuff all the time like what is that 3 horizontal line icon called.  It's called a "hamburger".  Makes me hungry now.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi how's it going! What kind of music do you like? I remember when I used to buy cd's, and it's still hard to believe that vinyl's are still being used today! <|endoftext|>  Hey, I'm good, thanks. How is your day? Yes, I'm also old enough to remember CD lol 
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you like music? <|endoftext|>  hi, yes I do, what about you? I love that Led zeppelin made an album with no title just to mess with the rock press

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you use the word tele or telly instead of television? <|endoftext|>  I tend to use the abbreviation T.V. and just say the letters. I think it is more of a regional thing though. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I'm doing good. Have you seen the film Thor? It's pretty good. 
 <|endoftext|>  did you use nintendo? Did you noticed that nintendo system could display only 54 colors? <|endoftext|>  No I wasn't really into Nintendo. I am more the music, film, dance type person.
 <|endoftext|>  how are you? do you have any interest in Space? I find Mars pretty cool, it was named after the Roman god of war <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Mars is interesting. Sounds have a higher pitch there than on Earth because of the atmosphere.
 <|endoftext|>  I thought it was very interesting that a married couple created the baseball schedule for 24 years <|endoftext|>  I don't know much about baseball.  Can you tell me more about that?  You mena they created the game schedule?

Alyssa Milano's mother tried to get rid of her nude shots and they were from major movies!  MLB is fighting a losing battle.

 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of football? I was watching and Tom Brady kinda flubbed his teams comeback at the end of the game . <|endoftext|>  Yes I am.  I guess he did that since they lost last minute to the Eagles.

I think it would be interesting to learn about Ted Kennedy. Political scandals can make great movies.
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about the Novel Literature prize being cancelled this year? <|endoftext|>  I think it's pretty intense, but I support the #MeToo movement so I guess I agree with the decision to put some space between the Nobel Literature Prize and the scandals

 <|endoftext|>  I read that, since 1900, the taller US candidate has won the election 75% of the time. What does that say about our society and how superficial we can be? <|endoftext|>  It says we are more concerned about what is on the outside than the inside.  I'm certain the prettier/more handsome candidate wins more than others as well.  I like the lengths India goes to for it's voters, setting up a polling booth in a forest full of lions for one voter.

As a scientist, I would approve the granny style, it is the most efficient way to throw the ball.

 <|endoftext|>  I was surprised to know that the average pay for a NBA player is the highest  for all professional sports.  <|endoftext|>  That's crazy I thought it was NFL.  I was surprised to know Reggie Miller's sister outscored him.

 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you have an interest in earth and other planets? <|endoftext|>  Sure! I live on the planet earth. It's my home. 
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning. Did you hear about the Trump and Kim Jong-un summit? Unfortunately they didn't get much done. <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? I did not hear much but I am not surprised. I think it's going to take a lot for Kim to change his beliefs.

Russia is not a very nice country though, did you know that during a g20 summit they gave delegates & heads of state thumb drives & phone chargers containing trojan viruses that were 'capable of illicitly picking up computer and mobile phone data'.

 <|endoftext|>  In authority regimes, a dictator or leader of one party state may also be called a president. <|endoftext|>  I think that's a somewhat underhanded way to hide the fact that the government is in fact a dicatorship.
 <|endoftext|>  I just read about this chick named Anne Jones who could read 4,700 words per minute <|endoftext|>  Thats crazy fast! I wonder how they meassure that, I heard she holds the World Record of speen reading

 <|endoftext|>  hey did you know that netflix makes up 33 percent of all internet bandwidht in north america? <|endoftext|>  I am guilty for that bandwidth too. Netflix offered Blockbuster to work with them in 2000 and Blockbuster laughed at them.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello Do you like Netflix or tv? <|endoftext|>  Hi there, I do like Netflix, although I only use it when at other people's houses.  I have cable tv at my home.  How about yourself?

 <|endoftext|>  Do you subscribe to Netflix? <|endoftext|>  My brother does and I use his account. I can't believe that blockbuster passed up deals to buy them for 50 million...especially cause now they are worth like 2 billy. 
 <|endoftext|>  Netflix is really cool but also influences teenagers a lot, have you seen the serie "Everything Sucks" <|endoftext|>  I have not, interesting title though. What is it about?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you watch Netflix or subscribe to the service by chance?  <|endoftext|>  No, I don't, but only because my internet connection wouldn't support it well.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that Netflix scientists did a study and that there are actually more instances of sex violence and smoking that on network TV <|endoftext|>  That's pretty interesting but Netflix doesn't have to worry about the FCC so I can see how it has more sex and violence
 <|endoftext|>  Do you have kids or a lot of experiences watching them? <|endoftext|>  I do, lots of nephews and neices.  You always have to be on guard.  Kids can get into danger very quickly
 <|endoftext|>  Being a parent can be hard, now a days theres many dangers <|endoftext|>  No kidding, especially if your child has a peanut allergy.  Simply inhaling peanut dust in the air can be deadly.

 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you doing today? What do you think of the presidency? <|endoftext|>  It is very depressing
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about Amys brother and his using the funds of his mom for himslef <|endoftext|>  I think that was a terrible thing he did.  He should be ashamed of himself.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like Orchestras ? Carlos Miguel Prieto made the conductor of the year <|endoftext|>  I don't really unless it is accompanied by dance. his performance seemed like it was going to be a defeat but suddenly became delightful
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there my friend! Do you like dogs by the way, we used to have a dog <|endoftext|>  Yeah, they are cool but they are a lot of work so I don't have one.
 <|endoftext|>  Did You know that there are 12 different blood types that a dog may have, and dogs can donate blood at dog blood drives ? <|endoftext|>  No i did not!  It's really cool, that Google is a dog company!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there!  Are you a fan of dogs? <|endoftext|>  Yeah I love dogs.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there! What kind of performance art do you enjoy for entertainment? I love going to a good concert. <|endoftext|>  HI, I love a good concert.

 <|endoftext|>  Hey there.  Have you heard about the National Symphony Orchestra's new conductor Carlos Miguel Prieto? <|endoftext|>  I have not heard of him, who is he?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you a fan of opera? <|endoftext|>  Hi!  I don't know much about it.  Do you like opera?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to go to concerts? <|endoftext|>  I do, what about you? I just love live music
 <|endoftext|>  hey did you know that the drive through was only invented in 1975? It seems like that wasn't too long ago <|endoftext|>  wow more than 40 years and we still use them, I wonder when the first car was created.

 <|endoftext|>  Are you a Tom Brady fan? <|endoftext|>  Not really, but I certainly respect his talent.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I can't believe that over a 17 year span, Tom Brady has been such a dynamic player in the NFL.
 <|endoftext|>  I think top athletes like Tom Brady need to be protective of their training methods so they can keep their competitive advantage. <|endoftext|>  Yes Tom Brady has shocked us all with his training
 <|endoftext|>  Do you think we could use lotteries today for elections? <|endoftext|>  No, I think it's fine the way it is.  I'm not sure I like the way delegates are used.  
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to watch television much? I used to watch comedy shows a lot, but I think I watch most stuff on YouTube now. How about you? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I watch TV, I like the Simpsons, Family Guy, and South Park the most.
 <|endoftext|>  hello,  did you know that the President's guest house is bigger than the white house?  lol  <|endoftext|>  Speaking of presidents, the only one with a phd is woodrow wilson.  I wonder what it is in?
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going? Do you watch much tv? Apparently there is only one episode of the simpsons without bart in it <|endoftext|>  I like watching TV, I sometime watch the simpson. I didn't know I though bart play in all the episodes.

 <|endoftext|>  Good morning! How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Doing great! Did you know that Google's self-driving cars have an aggressive mode? HAHA
 <|endoftext|>  Do you have a twitter account?  <|endoftext|>  I don't, do you? 
 <|endoftext|>  School shootings are so upsetting. <|endoftext|>  it is an unspeakable act
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like music? <|endoftext|>  I love music specially the guitar
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about Ryans message on fathers day? I think he made a mistake. <|endoftext|>  What was his message?

 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow the president? <|endoftext|>  Yes.  I follow politics to a degree.  So that would be our president.
 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  Not an enormous amount, but my teenager is a history buff, so I've been learning. Did you know the only pres to have a PhD was Woodrow Wilson?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi how are you doing? The top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson <|endoftext|>  That's surprising JFK was one of the wealthiest presidents, I figured there were more wealthy ex presidents than him
 <|endoftext|>  Good Morning! Do you like the keep up with current events? <|endoftext|>  Good morning. I do. What about you? 
 <|endoftext|>  Did you hear that an adult-film star was reportedly paid to stay silent about a sexual relationship with Trump before he was president? <|endoftext|>  Yes. And more than just one. Apparently "about 100 women" were also "taken care of." Sounds pretty sketchy. What do you think?
 <|endoftext|>  So I was reading about politics the other day, and did you know that President is actually a very common title for the head of state.  It isn't used exclusively in the US. <|endoftext|>  Hello there, yeah I have heard that before.  Do you know anything interesting about any other presidents around the world?
 <|endoftext|>  I think it is very strange that the senate has a candy desk.  <|endoftext|>  Yeah that is such a weird tradition.  I wonder what the wildest candy they have ever had in there is?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey did you hear about Trump talking about migrants recently? <|endoftext|>  Not sure, I might have. I don't really pay attention to politics. Too depressing.
 <|endoftext|>  Good afternoon. Wouldn't it be so stressful to be the president? The head of the whole country. <|endoftext|>  I think it would be. You have to appease everyone and that's the toughest job of all. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, are you ready to chat? <|endoftext|>  I am. Wondering if you know who Drake, the Canadian rapper is? Also know as Aubrey Drake Graham.
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about the case Stormy Daniels has against Trump? <|endoftext|>  I don't know, but Trump says it is a total con job though. Tough to know who is truthful.
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? do you like to dance? <|endoftext|>  I do but I am not great! Did you know Tupac danced ballet in high school?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, I'm reading about a 2 year old who met Michelle Obama after a photo of her viewing Michelle Obama's portrait went viral. <|endoftext|>  oh that was so heartwarming to see actually. nice of her to meet the little girl

 <|endoftext|>  Have you seen the show The Romanoffs? <|endoftext|>  I have not, I didn't realize it existed!  Have you seen it?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello!  How you doing?  Did you know that up until 1805 the runner up in a President race would become the vice president?  Can't imagine all the fighting and jealousy THAT would have caused! <|endoftext|>  I'm great how are you! Oh I'm sure I couldn't believe that either. The Vice President probably always prayed something would happen to the president haha.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, Do you enjoy using the internet? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I am on the Internet all day, every day.  I just learned something new.  Did you know that the 3 horizontal line menu on apps and websites is called a hamburger button?  How cool is that?

 <|endoftext|>  do you like cars? <|endoftext|>  I sure do. Do you know how the drive thru came about?
 <|endoftext|>  McDonald's started the drive-thru when they wanted soldiers to be able to get their food, soldiers weren't aloud out of their vehicles while wearing their fatigues! <|endoftext|>  Good idea to help those who can't leave! 
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning <|endoftext|>  Good morning. I was schocked to know that 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car when German inventor Karl Benz patented his Benz Patent-Motorwagen. I thought it was Ford
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to go to the library? <|endoftext|>  I love going to the library, though I tend to borrow things that have digital copies nowadays. It's a relief to me to find out that over half the adults in the US have library cards

 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you use the internet much? I know thats an obvious question considering the time and age we are on <|endoftext|>  I do for sure, it's an amazing invention, definitely progressed civilization so much. It's crazy to think that it all began commercially in the early 1990s@
 <|endoftext|>  I can't imagine how we used to live without the Internet.  I started using it in the 90's but before then we had nothing!    <|endoftext|>  We had phones, which was virtual reality enough for some. But I get what you're saying. Today that WAS like NOTHING compared to WWW reach and its entertainment options. Right?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you watch Johnny English Strikes Again? <|endoftext|>  Is that the film with Mr. Bean?
 <|endoftext|>  Johnny English Strikes Again was a really funny movie, do you agree <|endoftext|>  I haven't seen it. What is it about?
 <|endoftext|>  do you like horror movies? <|endoftext|>  Yes somewhat. how about you?

I didn't know that about the king of Hawaii. I didn't actually know Hawaii had a king.

Ya know, Taiwan is recognized as a sovereign nation by 21 countries. But recently three have reversed that position.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a House fan? Hugh Laurie earned 700 thousand per episode. That's insane. <|endoftext|>  I'm not but my parents are so I am a little familiar. That's a huge paycheck. I did not realize it had that big of an audience. 
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of fiction books?  <|endoftext|>  Yea, my favorite fiction is short stories and novels, do you?
 <|endoftext|>  It's crazy that the wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson. <|endoftext|>  JFK I could see but Washington and Jefferson surprise me.  I thought Washington was just a general before becoming president.

I think there's some rap songs about this. <|endoftext|>  I think that a lot of rich people are famous, so when they do bad things, it is more public.  I do not think rich people are more inclined to be bad

 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that cars have now existed for over 150 years? <|endoftext|>  Wow I didn't know that. I do know that they were created first by Karl Benz. I think he started the company Mercedes-Benz with someone else. You drive a car by the way?

 <|endoftext|>  Do you remember the Micheal Brown shooting in Ferguson Mo?  It was so heartbreaking. The Prosecuter Rober McCulloch said that he was impartial. <|endoftext|>  I remember too well, very very sad. And since the grand jury decided to not indict Darren Wilson for his murdering Michael Brown it caused so many protests, I don't think it was right. There was so much media about it on Facebook it was crazy!

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Good.  So, what do you think about presidents with beards always being republican?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you really believe Kim Jong-un was voted sexiest man? <|endoftext|>  That is hard to believe but it was The Onion so I'm sure it was done facetiously. I think it's even sadder that China actually believes it to be true. 
 <|endoftext|>  hi do you watch much tv? <|endoftext|>  I sure do. Do you ever watch the SImpsons?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Good, I am reading fun facts about TV. Do you know how many pokemon there are?

 <|endoftext|>  Good morning. Do you like watching YouTube videos? I was just surprised to find it was the second largest search engine on the net. <|endoftext|>  YouTube was purchased by google, so I guess they share search engine technology. I do like YouTube.
 <|endoftext|>  do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  SOme stuff. Do you know who the three wealthiest ones are?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? What do you think of the president? <|endoftext|>  But I think he says a lot of interesting things. I was shocked to learn that he's not one of the top three richest presidents though
 <|endoftext|>  do you know much about the president? <|endoftext|>  Yes I know that Wilson was the only one to have a PhD
 <|endoftext|>  I suspect the information about the richest presidents is out of date now. I don't think any of the three listed would have qualified as billionaires in today's terms. <|endoftext|>  I dont know how they adjust the value of the land that washington and jefferson owned. was it rich for their time?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow the government much? <|endoftext|>  I try to know only what is necessary.  It is crazy sometimes.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you follow politics? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do. It is important to know about the politics going on. Especially in the senate since it is considered the more deliberative and more prestigious body than the House of Representatives.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to dance.  <|endoftext|>  I do but I am not coordinated so no one likes to dance with me.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello - how are you doing today? <|endoftext|>  Great. Hope you're well! So are you a fan of dancing? Bruce Lee happened to be an outstanding dancer and even won the Cha-Cha championship in Hong Kong back in 1958.

 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever been on a bad date? <|endoftext|>  Oh yeah, I have been on the bad date and have probably been the bad date, a couple times. Lol. Meetups are really hard to master.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, what did you think about Kim Kardashian West's visit to the White House? <|endoftext|>  interesting, she went there to talk about prison reform 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you familiar with the scandal surrounding Kim Kardashian and the White House? <|endoftext|>  No! I'm learning about it now. it's pretty crayz. It makes sense since trump got his start on reality tv. I didn't know Sylvester Stallone also did something similar!
 <|endoftext|>  I've got to admit that I was one of the people ridiculing Kim K for visiting the white house, but after hearing more about what she accomplished, I have more respect for her. How do you feel? <|endoftext|>  I agree that here accomplishments merit some degree of respect. I wonder why people would choose to ridicule her
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, what are your thought on Trump, do you like him as president? <|endoftext|>  I try to support all Presidents. I feel like he gets a lot of flack. 
 <|endoftext|>  Did you hear about the first crash of an F-35 aircraft? <|endoftext|>  Yes I did. It was the first crash of an F-35 aircraft in about 17 years. I wonder what the cause of the crash was, they won't say
 <|endoftext|>  You do much fishing?  I did a little bit as a kid, but never had much luck with it.  I never knew freshwater fish only "drink" through their skin.  Kind of like frogs can. <|endoftext|>  Not much fishing recently. Heard about freshwater osmosis. Fished trout streams, mostly. You?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of our president? <|endoftext|>  Not at all, especially after this whole wall thing. Are you?
 <|endoftext|>  the black swallower fish can eat prey twice its own length. how is that even possible? <|endoftext|>  Can't snakes do that too? Did you read about the fighter jet that crashed? Luckily the pilot ejected to safety but still, that's scary!
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! Did you know you can pick up radio storms from Jupiter on an AM radio? Crazy.  <|endoftext|>  Hi! I didn't know that! That is amazing! i wonder what the Jupiter storms sound like.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there! Would you mind sharing with me, your political orientation? Personally, I call myself an independent. But I'd kind of prefer the term unaffiliated.  <|endoftext|>  I am also Independent or unaffiliated! Ha
 <|endoftext|>  hello - how do you feel about the issue of gun control <|endoftext|>  I'm on the fence
 <|endoftext|>  What do you know about the NFL? <|endoftext|>  I know a lot about it. Do you like the NFL?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a big fan of Tom Brady? <|endoftext|>  He's not my favorite, but I will admit that he is one of the best NFL quarterbacks. Did you see him win his sixth Super Bowl?
 <|endoftext|>  You much of a football fan?  I don't watch it much myself, but I find a lot of facts about it pretty neat... <|endoftext|>  Im in the same boat.  No cable for me so many games go unwatched.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a football fan, I just moved to the Boston area four years ago so I got kind of sucked into that. Funny, the author of the Game of Thrones compares the Patriots to the Lannisters. <|endoftext|>  Lol, I am a Vikings fan. Patriots are a great team but I can see the resemblance lol!
 <|endoftext|>  hey do you ever watch the NFL/ <|endoftext|>  I only watch the Super Bowl because I go to a party. I guess that's usually the first Sunday in February.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I am good and yourself?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you a football fan? If so, do you have a favorite team? <|endoftext|>  Hello, yes I am a football fan. I do not have a favorite NFL team because I am from Michigan and the Lions haven't been performing well, but I do love U of M football. I was actually in a class at Uof M with Tom Brady back in the day. He wasn't what he is today at the time though.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you watch the Super Bowl? <|endoftext|>  I did, I found it to be a bit boring, you?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you see the Patriots game against the Bills today? <|endoftext|>  Yeah, but not much because I thought they would win eventually
 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you watch NFL? <|endoftext|>  I do! Of the 32 teams, the dolphins are my favorite. We haven't been good in years.

 <|endoftext|>  did you know that tom brady's wife make twice as much as tom brady? thats crazy <|endoftext|>  No, that was very interesting to me. I knew she was a model, but I assumed their salaries were more equitable.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  Do you watch TV? <|endoftext|>  I love TV. It seems like the TV began with computer monitors back in the late 90s.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, are you into fitness? <|endoftext|>  I wouldn't say I was into fitness, but I do like to stay active, I run a lot.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to work out at the gym? <|endoftext|>  Yea but I usually avoid going in January, it's always crowded with so many people signing up for the new year
 <|endoftext|>  It's cool that Hybrid Theory is so popular. I loved Linkin Park -- they were one of the early 00s groups that were like holdovers from the grunge era. <|endoftext|>  I was a huge fan of Linkin Park too.  They have the highest selling album of the 21st century still I think.  Very sad what happened to their lead singer.

 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, are you a fan of the current US president? <|endoftext|>  hI! I am not actually but that is just my opinion. I do like the fact the president had a good meeting with KimJong Un.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Do you feel Trump's maximum pressure approach played a role in getting Kim Jong Un to the bargaining table? I'm torn on the issue as I also feel policy played a role as well. <|endoftext|>  I definitely feel Trump's maximum pressure approach was at play. But I also believe Trump is a good business man, and his ability to talk with Kim Jong Un helped his success
 <|endoftext|>  Have you been to any concerts? <|endoftext|>  I have been to a few concerts over the years. My favorite is probably Heart. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Do you watch cable news? Don't worry no judgment on my part no matter what you watch. <|endoftext|>  I avoid cable news.  Everything is so slanted.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like the NFL? <|endoftext|>  I love it. Did you know that women can play in the NFL too?
 <|endoftext|>  I find the idea that universes evolve through natural selection fascinating. I guess this refers to the idea of a multiverse that's constantly percolating new universes out?  <|endoftext|>  Yes I think so. The universe sure is interesting.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi there! How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Im great, are you a religious person? 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! I found it interesting to learn that the same gavel was used for 165 years in the US Senate! I also thought it was ironic that Richard Nixon was the one to crack it, considering his corruption in the government <|endoftext|>  Ironic to say the least lol.  Did you know that in '88 a us senator allowed the sergeant at arms to arrest absent senators and bring them to chamber to vote.  One tried to escape but was caught and carried back in.

 <|endoftext|>  Hey what's up. How do you feel about Trump? Despite everything he has done he has done no wrong in terms of the GOP support. <|endoftext|>  I think the real statistics on job growth, the GDP, more jobs for minorities and other things show he is doing a good job unlike what 95% of the democrat led press is saying.
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about Trump's performance at Helsinki against Putin ? <|endoftext|>  Hey! I honestly don't remember it very well. I didn't find something specific in the summit. They didn't reach any agreements, right?

 <|endoftext|>  Hey there do you watch television? I don't really watch TV myself <|endoftext|>  I like watching shows, but TV feels outdated. It's not on my schedule but on the TV's schedule. Very inconvenient.

 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy drama as a genre? <|endoftext|>  Not as much as other genres, but if it's good I'll watch it! Why do you ask?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that Canada has two national sports: lacrosse and ice hockey? <|endoftext|>  No I didn't know that, why do you think Canada is so good at hockey though? Apparently they scored like 130 goals and only let in three goals in the entire first Olympic Winter Games back in 1924

 <|endoftext|>  Hey there what do you think about the White House? <|endoftext|>  I think the White House is an important piece/place in history that has housed numerous presidents and is recognized around the world. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello What do you think of the president? <|endoftext|>  I feel we did not have good choices to chose from.  So in my mind he was not a good choice but a lesser bad choice.   What do you think of his summit with Kim?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that the runner-up for the US President used to automatically become the vice-president? <|endoftext|>  I never knew that, did you know that the president of Indonesia released 3 pop albums while he was president? Crazy.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that Trump cancelled his trip to Ireland because of his climate policies? <|endoftext|>  Yea, sounds like they were planning to protest a variety of things involving his administration.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you want to talk about the White House, the President, or the Summit Meeting? <|endoftext|>  Let's talk about the White House, did you know that they have twin buildings of it in both France and Ireland? I wonder if they're the same on the inside as well

 <|endoftext|>  Hello!  I wonder if Donald trump is one of the top three wealthiest presidents in history with Washington, Jefferson and JFK? <|endoftext|>  I'm sure he is, actually with little doubt considering how long ago washington and jefferson were in office. I wonder who was least wealthy?

 <|endoftext|>  I was reading an article and it stated that our White House has twin buildings in Ireland and France. I thought that was interesting <|endoftext|>  I think so too!

 <|endoftext|>  Do you ever play golf?  It can be a fun, but very challenging sport. <|endoftext|>  Yes, I do, but not very often. The cost of playing is prohibitive for me. I don't have a private golf course like Trump, nor am I a millionaire like many of our former presidents.

 <|endoftext|>  Good morning!  It's a snowy day here and I was thinking of spending some time with a movie.  Do you like dramas? <|endoftext|>  I'm more of a comedy person myself, but I understand that drama is traditionally the middle ground between comedy and tragedy.  
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, how are you? Do you like cars? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do like cars. It's crazy that the first car was invented in the late 1800s that seems so long ago
 <|endoftext|>  Unfortunately, at the Youth Peace Center in Chicago a person spoke of being shot six times in the back of the head. "It was like Iraq", the person said, but he hasn't been in Iraq. <|endoftext|>  What a sad day. Also the day of the Parkland, FL shooting. WHat is wrong with people these days?
 <|endoftext|>  Have you heard of the Chicago massacre? People compared it to war. Chicago has a high murder rate. <|endoftext|>  Yes it's a shame.I think that the tearing down of the high rise public housing caused the diffusion of gang problems into other neighborhoods.
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, did you know Karl Benz was the first person to patent the car? <|endoftext|>  I didn't.  It makes sense... Did you know that McDonald's developed drive-thus to help soldiers?  I helped me too.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi.  I don't know what I'd do without a telephone.  Did you know an iPhone has more computing power that the entire U.S. nuclear deterrent?  Wow. <|endoftext|>  Yes, that says a lot about both things doesn't it?  I agree, my phone is my lifeline as well.  It's funny how vulnerable they seem to be.  The cables carrying phone and Internet data across oceans are only 2.7 inches in diameter and just lay on the ocean floor.
 <|endoftext|>  hey what are your thoughts on Pink Floyd? <|endoftext|>  pretty cool, as cool as to play a concerts in an ancient amphitheatre without an audience?

 <|endoftext|>  I never knew that the reason a baseball manager wore a uniform was so that he could play if needed. Did you? <|endoftext|>  I did not know that at all thats a cool thing to learn
 <|endoftext|>  Hi.  Do you use facebook?  Did you know that it was launched back in 2004? <|endoftext|>  Hi, I remember it launching. Myspace at the time was so much better. They actually had the chance to buy facebook in 2005 for just 75 million but turned it down. oops.

 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, did you know every president since John Adams has lived in the White House? <|endoftext|>  No I didn't know that. I also didn't know that the White House has twin buildings around the world, one is in France and another is in Ireland
 <|endoftext|>  I would like to visit the White House some day, so many history in one place. <|endoftext|>  It is a wonderful place. But the president there now is making false statement.
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning!  Do you use facebook?  Can you believe it was launched back in 2004? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do! It is very hard to believe wow. I remember when I first got mine. Don't use it so much anymore. Hard to believe a third of all divorce filings in the USA in 2011 contained the word "facebook"
 <|endoftext|>  Did you hear what happened with the legislator from Minnesota? <|endoftext|>  I hadn't until today. Allegations like that can sure change your career path. Not surprised no charges were filed though.

 <|endoftext|>  Hey there, do you follow politics much? <|endoftext|>  Yes, mainly the President and actions taken by Congress.  Lately, I was surprised to know that Trump wasn't one of the top 3 richest presidents. 
 <|endoftext|>  It's crazy to think that the top three richest presidents were JFK, Washington and Thomas Jefferson.  <|endoftext|>  Yeah, I agree.  They must have factored inflation into that

 <|endoftext|>  Do you like golf? <|endoftext|>  Phil and Tiger are my favorite players. 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy magic? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I am entertained by magic. I especially enjoyed the movie with Hugh Jackman about magician, though I forget what it was called. Do you?

 <|endoftext|>  Hey there what do you think about Kanye West? <|endoftext|>  I think Kanye needs to see a mental health professional, as those around him are not giving him the help he needs. That "dragon energy" bit was bizarre, but he was on to something with that hydrogen power that everyone glossed over.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there! How are you doing this fine Internet evening? <|endoftext|>  Hi! I'm just catching up on some reading and saw that Chance the Rapper received backlash for sharing his opinion about not needing to support Democrats.

 <|endoftext|>  Did you hear about Duke Ellington School of the Arts in DC and its $180 million remodel? That's a lot, but it sounds like a good school. <|endoftext|>  I did not hear about that. I was more interested in the scandal. 
 <|endoftext|>  do you watch tv? <|endoftext|>  a lot. do you watch the simpsons?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you hear about the Duke Ellington Scandal by the way? <|endoftext|>  I did. Regarding the School of the Arts? Apparently there was cheating in order to avoid paying tuition.
 <|endoftext|>  do you watch tv? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do. DO you like the SImpsons?
 <|endoftext|>  Interesting that the 70's show was remade verbatim in the UK.  <|endoftext|>  Yeah,  but I didnt know England even had the 1970s... I guess that is why it was canceled after only 10 episodes.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you still have cable tv or did you cut the cord? <|endoftext|>  I rent a house with my brother, I mooch off his cable
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know the founding story behind Netflix? One of the guys ran up a late fee, and was so disgusted that he started netflix! <|endoftext|>  No, I didn't know that!  Funny that Blockbuster could have bought Netflix and didn't 
 <|endoftext|>  It was fascinating how they tied all of those diverse topics together, Disinformation, Smoking, Google <|endoftext|>  Do you  think the US anti-smoking campaign does fight disinformation?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, what are your thoughts on the US senate? <|endoftext|>  Hey. I think they have a very important job being the upper chamber of the US Congress.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow the US Senate at all? <|endoftext|>  I did the Kavanaugh stuff. Did you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, did you know that Kristjen Nielsen is the US Homeland Security Secretary.   <|endoftext|>  I was aware of that yes. She has held a lot of press briefings. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, how are you this evening? <|endoftext|>  Very well, thank you. I hope you are as well?  Not doing your laundry in the famous geyser, Old Faithful, as was the ritual in the old days?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you hear that the Norwegian government donated money to save the Amazon rainforest? I guess they've got cash to spare in Norway. <|endoftext|>  Must be nice! Do you smoke?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi. Do you like going to concerts? Linking Park played three hundred and twenty four concerts in 2001 alone! <|endoftext|>  Yea, I'd love to have went to the 1972 Deep Purple concert that was the loudest ever
 <|endoftext|>  Hi do you follow football? <|endoftext|>  Good afternoon, yes, i do a little.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi.  I guess for those people missing NFL games they can do fantasy.  I know my grandson is really into it.  He's a huge Andrew Luck fan and hopes to ride him to a good season. <|endoftext|>  i have never tried fantasy sports. how does it work? do you bet or something?
 <|endoftext|>  Aretha Franklin's passing was quite a big deal from history, art, society, music on a lot of levels. <|endoftext|>  She was amazing. I heard her funeral was quite a production. She was carried in the same white cadillac that carried Rosa Parks and her father Rev. CL Franklin
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning, do you like football? <|endoftext|>  Yea, I love the nfl which is known as Gridiron football around the world, do you?
 <|endoftext|>  hey there, are you a fan of concerts? <|endoftext|>  Yes.  I love concerts.  I am always reading reviews about concerts.  Did you know that in 2002, a Creed concert was so bad that people walked out and sued the band.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a football fan? American style. <|endoftext|>  I enjoy fantasy football, particularly in week 8.
 <|endoftext|>  I have grown up in an era when Arethra Franklin has not been active as an entertainer. I did not expect so many famous people to attend her funeral. <|endoftext|>  She was admired by many who came from different backgrounds
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going? Have you heard about the two nooses found at the Mississippi State Capitol? How appalling <|endoftext|>  Hello! Yes I have heard it, it's terrible. I think it's indicative of a larger problem. Trump was going to speak for Cindy Hyde-Smith that same day I believe, and she made a joke recently about a "public hanging", it's absurd.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I'm great! Do you listen to the radio?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello.  Anybody there?  I am trapped in the US Senate chamber and I can't get out! <|endoftext|>  Ok, it might be awhile, you know how slow they are to move in Washington. Lol
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that every US president with a beard has been a republican?  <|endoftext|>  Must be something in their philosophy.  Hopefully if they have a female candidate one day it not a requirement.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, did you know the US Senate used the same gavel for 165 years until Nixon broke it!  Sign of things to come... <|endoftext|>  I didn't know this. Who is the presiding officer of the Senate?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow US politics? <|endoftext|>  Yes I think it's important to stay up-to-date. The Republican Party currently controls the presidency. Or should I say the Grand Old Party!
 <|endoftext|>  Hello - did you know the top 3 wealthiest presidents in US history were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson? <|endoftext|>  I've heard that. It's hard to believe that Trump isn't even in the top. 
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning! Do you like politics? <|endoftext|>  Hi, tricky question.  I like following political news but talking it can sometimes be difficult.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you think it is OK for the opposing party to criticize past presidents? <|endoftext|>  I am not sure, I think instead of bringing people down by bringing up negative stuff about other people,  that people should just say positive things about themselves. 
 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you know much about us politics? <|endoftext|>  somewhat, lets talk about the senate. they used the same gavel for 165 years until nixon cracked it
 <|endoftext|>  How are you? Did you know the Republican party was founded in 1854? <|endoftext|>  Never knew that! It was founded by anti-slavery activists, economic modernizers, ex-National Republicans, ex-Free Soilers and Whigs. It seems to have changed though. 
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know the Republican Party is also referred to as the GOP (Grand Old Party)? <|endoftext|>  I've heard that. It's crazy to think that there hasn't been a president who wasn't democrat or republican since 1853. Maybe time for more than two parties?
 <|endoftext|>  Have you heard of the idiots who hung nooses outside the Capitol building in Mississippi? <|endoftext|>  I did, that was absolutely awful, I don't think they have found them yet.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, are you particularly interested in politics? <|endoftext|>  I am very interested in politics, though it's hard to stay keep up with Trump, Pence, and most of the Republican party these days.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Good, thanks for asking.  Keeping an eye on the nation's politics, especially the presidency which is quite a prominent role.
 <|endoftext|>  do you know much about the us senate? <|endoftext|>  Yes I know that they had the same gavel for 165 years until Nixon broke it
 <|endoftext|>  The Virginia House trying to expand medicare using Trump and Pence is an odd occurance <|endoftext|>  I agree. House Speaker M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) contends that expanding the federal-state health-care program during the Trump administration offers the "best chance for conservative reforms."
 <|endoftext|>  Are you familiar with the US elected positions like the senate or president? <|endoftext|>  Yes.  I know the U.S. senate just had  a runoff featuring a black democrat.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, do you know much about politics in general? <|endoftext|>  Yes I follow it a lot.  It is awful what Republican leaders are doing.  They will not stand up to Trump at all.
 <|endoftext|>  did you know that Trump wouldn't be in the top 3 wealthiest presidents? Like that must be adjusted for inflation <|endoftext|>  I did not. That would be an interesting thing to look into. Speaking of presidents, did you know that the first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there. The President is something else, huh. He sure travels all over too. <|endoftext|>  yes he is always on news 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow politics much? Every once in a while I'll see an article that catches my eye <|endoftext|>  Yeah from time to time. Do you know much about the Senate in the US?
 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever followed the story of the Zodiac killer? <|endoftext|>  Yes I am listening to a podcast about him.  It took a long time to catch him!
 <|endoftext|>  Are you familiar with the Website IMDB? <|endoftext|>  Yes I've heard of it before. I use it almost every day actually, what about you? I do know that Amazon owns them
 <|endoftext|>  Hello - how are you today? <|endoftext|>  I am doing great. How about you.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there.  Here's hoping you're not in Florida's Gulf Coast.  Seems to be storm central <|endoftext|>  Yea, people had to be evacuated due to Subtropical Storm Alberto
 <|endoftext|>  Hi do you use your phone much? <|endoftext|>  Hi there, yes quite a bit actually. Do you know who invented the dial phone?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you know much about telephones? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do.  New York has the fastest number to dial on a rotary phone

 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you a traveler? <|endoftext|>  Somewhat, mostly domestically.  Have you ever heard of U2's song, "With or Without You"?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you think that the American culture doesn't prioritize families? Are parent doing their job? <|endoftext|>  I think there is less and less prioritizing on families and family life as time goes on. 
 <|endoftext|>  Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford seemed really skilled, they won a lot of titles. <|endoftext|>  what are they skilled at?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello. <|endoftext|>  Hi

 <|endoftext|>  The dutch are creating a commuter bus which goes 160mph!  That is crazy! <|endoftext|>  Wow! I guess that is definitely one way to travel. Do you prefer to travel on foot, bike, car, or other means?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there. Telephones are great, but we can talk using our computers too. <|endoftext|>  Yep, I last used a landline about 13 years ago. Crazy to think the cablese that carry phone traffic are only about 3 inches wide and just lay on the ocean floor.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow Olympic figure skating?  <|endoftext|>  No, I don't really know much about the sport.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy traveling? <|endoftext|>  Hi, yes traveling is a hobby of mine.Ya know the first king who traveled around the world was hawaiian.
 <|endoftext|>  Parenting has certainly changed since i was a child. How about you? <|endoftext|>  It does seem a bit different now a day, I feel like our culture is not concerned enough about family values.
 <|endoftext|>  do you like to travel? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do a lot. Did you hear of the fast bush the dutch are building?
 <|endoftext|>  The NBA is the basketball league in North America, it consists of 30 teams. <|endoftext|>  Oh wow I didn't know there were 30 teams.

 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of basketball? <|endoftext|>  I am, I like the game, are you a fan?
 <|endoftext|>  Good evening!  Are you an NBA fan? <|endoftext|>  I try to watch the finals. especially if golden state is in them. You?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like cars? <|endoftext|>  They are useful. I have a fiat now.

 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, are you a fan of the NFL? <|endoftext|>  Hello, I am not a fan of the NFL. I watch it if my family watches it.

 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you like horses? <|endoftext|>  Hello - yes, I think they are very cool creatures. What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to classical music at all? I think it is kind of funny that a shopping center in australia play it in order to stop teens from loitering. That is one way to do it. <|endoftext|>  I do not really.  However this music does span across many eras.  This also refers to the period from 1750-1820.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like Classical Musica?  <|endoftext|>  I do, I listen to classical music when I want to focus or when I have a tight deadline in front of me, what about you?

 <|endoftext|>  The White House is a place with a lot of history dont you think? <|endoftext|>  Hello there, yeah it sure does, since 1801 I think. 
 <|endoftext|>  The president sure does an important job <|endoftext|>  Some might say he does a bad job at an important job lol. It's too bad there's not a backup to balance out his worse impulses; until 1805, the runner-up in the election became VP. One can only wonder how Hillary Clinton would influence decisions with her perspective.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow the US senate? <|endoftext|>  I do somewhat.  I know that there is 100 US senators.  2 from each state.

 <|endoftext|>  hey there did you know that JFK was one of the wealthiest US presidents? <|endoftext|>  No, I did not know though... I did know George Washington was one as well.  I wonder where JFK got all his money from... I mean, what type of business his family was into..

 <|endoftext|>  Hello, isnt it amazing how we can access many services though the internet <|endoftext|>  Yes, it is. The Internet is a modern miracle, though some of the terminology is odd. I didn't know that the little icon with three horizontal stripes is called the hamburger button.
 <|endoftext|>  How familiar are you with how the internet actually works? <|endoftext|>  I can't say that I'm super famlliar, what I do know is that in Finland, internet access is a literal personal right haha

 <|endoftext|>  Do you like the FIFA World Cup?  <|endoftext|>  I do like the FIFA World Cup it's crazy that it's awarded every 4 years except when it wasn't held during World War II
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there are you a soccer fan? <|endoftext|>  I like soccer, mostly just when the World Cup is around, are you a fan?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums while in office?  <|endoftext|>  Did he really? That's kind of funny! I also think it's funny that the US president's guest house is actually bigger than the white house itself. It's like, I didn't even know the president had a guest house!
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like basketball much? <|endoftext|>  It's not one of my most favorite sports because I'm a little on the short side so I was never very good at it! How about you?

 <|endoftext|>  Hello, are you a Republican or Democrat? <|endoftext|>  I am a republican, how about you?
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going? Did you know the size of the entire Universe is till unknown? <|endoftext|>  I think I did know that! The universe is so crazy. There are people who believe that the universe is actually virtual reality. Did you know that (though it's impossible) if you folded paper 103 times, it would be as thick as the universe that we can observe?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello. What do you think of the universe? <|endoftext|>  Well, I think it's vast and that our human minds can't even begin to comprehend it.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there!  Are you a basketball fan?  I am Bulls fan and we stink!  We are probably as good as the Lakers though which is funny since they had such high expectations. <|endoftext|>  I'm a little bit of a fan. I watch some of the Spurs games.  Have you heard of Tim Duncan?

 <|endoftext|>  Hello, how do you feel about assault rifles? <|endoftext|>  A rifle is a rifle.  The term "assault" means nothing other than its superficial characteristics.  A bullet from an AR-15 will kill just as a bullet from a hunting rifle.  
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you follow politics? <|endoftext|>  I do. Do you?
 <|endoftext|>  The republican party is full with controversy <|endoftext|>  Is that right?  Why do you say that?

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  It's interesting how Trump has such loyal supporters that they would wait in a lawn chair before an event where he will be attending.
 <|endoftext|>  I think our government is failing us and it's primarily the President's fault. <|endoftext|>  I do not believe that. I believe that the media is making it look that way.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow politics at all? <|endoftext|>  I actually do. My Twitter is full of it, lol. I thought Obama had a PHD, but I guess Wilson was the only president who has one.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello do you know much about the presidents? <|endoftext|>  Yeah here and there. DO you know who the three wealthiest ones in the US are?
 <|endoftext|>  I think it is interesting that the President is not just a term for the US.  Many other countries have Presidents too <|endoftext|>  Interesting I know Guatemala is one that does this.  I wonder what some other ones are.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you a voter? <|endoftext|>  Yea, it's pretty crazy a chimpanzee got 400,000 votes in a mayoral election
 <|endoftext|>  do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  I know some stuff, like who the three wealthiest guys are so far, and you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey! Are you interested in politics? <|endoftext|>  I do follow a bit, right now everything political is so tense, especially with Trumps comments.
 <|endoftext|>  Can you believe the first president of Zimbabwe was called "President Banana"? That's pretty crazy  <|endoftext|>  hahaha thats wierd.  1988 a chimpanzee received 400.000 votes in a mayoral election in rio de janeiro, coming in third place.
 <|endoftext|>  Good Morning! Have you been to any concerts lately? <|endoftext|>  No, in fact I don't quite remember my last concert. Like the Ramone who probably don't remember their first concerts, they have been touring for 20 years.

 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you want to chat about the President, Voting, or the Republicans?   <|endoftext|>  Hey how is it going, I'm down for whatever. Voting is pretty patriotic though, unlike the President.
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, did you know president is a common title for heads of states in most republics? <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? yes, the title is widely used but it seems to have many meanings
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how are you, what do you think of the president <|endoftext|>  I think he is doing good, did you know that the U.S. President's guest house is larger than the White House?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how's it going? I think voting is so important. Astronauts even vote from space. <|endoftext|>  I agree.  I'm personally Republican.  I don't have a beard, but every US President with a beard has been a Republican.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  Do you follow politics? <|endoftext|>  Yes. Vote, too. You?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know the president of Indoensia has released 3 pop albums while in office?  <|endoftext|>  That is pretty wild, it would be like Trump doing more Celebrity Apprentice shows.

 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, did you know audio cassettes albums began in the 1970s? <|endoftext|>  I didn't know that. What about CDs, in the 80s? 
 <|endoftext|>  They say that even the ushers dance at a Stevie Wonder concert. <|endoftext|>  I heard that! Awesome! Do you have a favorite Album?

 <|endoftext|>  Did you ever go to college? What are the skills that you think we're the most necessary to your success <|endoftext|>  I did.  What you learn in college is very different from what you need for real life success.  Like how to buy a house, insurance, medical stuff...

 <|endoftext|>  What forms of entertainment do you enjoy? <|endoftext|>  I enjoy movies and television shows.  Do you use Facebook?

 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you vote regularly during elections? <|endoftext|>  I always vote and am glad the Democrats got control of the house.   Its crazy people blame them for the shutdown when Trump couldn't get his wall when the Republicans ran everything
 <|endoftext|>  I know a poll is saying Trump is responsible for the shutdown.  What do you think? <|endoftext|>  I agree, Trump has caused a lot of division and its not a coincidence its the biggest shutdown in history.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! How are you today? <|endoftext|>  I am doing well, yourself?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello,  how are you doing?  Do you like football? The university of iowa's locker room for visiting football teams is completely painted pink <|endoftext|>  I guess the pink is meant to soften up the opposition. The game of football certainly has a lot of interesting history.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you like football? <|endoftext|>  I do, especially gridiron football,not so much association football. 
 <|endoftext|>  Trump's treatment of black female journalists is pretty awful, isn't it? <|endoftext|>  Yes, he told a black female reporter

 <|endoftext|>  Did you hear how the government was planning on destroying wikileaks? It was published on their website. <|endoftext|>  I did hear about that.

Also scary is that the Chinese government censor the word for censorship, that's how you know you're screwed LOL
 <|endoftext|>  Do you sense that we now have a space race among private companies? <|endoftext|>  I do.I find the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, which includes Space X, to be a big indicator that space flight is being privatized. 
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? what do you think of elon musk? <|endoftext|>  I think his a genius, many people might hate him but I think he is really smart, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Up until 1805 the loser of the election became Vp. How crazy <|endoftext|>  I think that system would be great nowadays. The system couldn't work worse! It would be entertaining too.

 <|endoftext|>  hi, how are you doing today? <|endoftext|>  I'm great, how are you?  So, it seems like people either love Trump or hate Trump... How do you feel?
 <|endoftext|>  did you know that the taller candidate wins in american politics about 75% of the time? <|endoftext|>  I believe it because Trump won Hilary.  She also lost even though she won the popular vote just like five other presidents were elected while still losing the popular vote.  
 <|endoftext|>  Hello how are you doing?  Do you watch much YouTube?  I was just reading some interesting facts about them.  Youtube is the second largest search engine on the net. <|endoftext|>  Hi I am good. Yes I love youtube. How about you?

 <|endoftext|>  I bet Trump thinks he one of the top three wealthiest presidents. do you know who they are really?  <|endoftext|>  yeah, I was surprised that Trump did not make the top 3, probably old data before Trump was elected
 <|endoftext|>  What is your attitude toward Canada? <|endoftext|>  I think they've been good to us, but Trump does not seem to like them.

 <|endoftext|>  Huge scare for Post Malone on his recent flight <|endoftext|>  I guess so! Loved his response to all the haters though!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you today? <|endoftext|>  i'm good. Probably more comfortable than Post Malone was after his emergency airplane landing!
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, do you watch much tv? I love south Park, the simpsons sent them flowers after they aired the family guy spoof episode <|endoftext|>  That is really clever, I will need to see that!
 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to the radio?  Apparently, Canadian Law requires radios to have at least 40% of music played be Canadian. <|endoftext|>  That is pretty funny. I personally don't listen to the radio. I mostly listen to YouTube. And I would rather listen to classical Latin then listen to the Canadian radio LOL

 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about the MAGA hats? Do you think states should prevent people wearing them at a polling place? <|endoftext|>  No I don't think so. It sets a bad precedent, what do you think about Hope Hicks and the omerta code by the way?
 <|endoftext|>  I like to read about history. Did you know that the runner up in the presidential election automatically became vice president until 1805? <|endoftext|>  i had no idea about that
 <|endoftext|>  Hey what do you think about Hope Hicks? She recently met with President Trump <|endoftext|>  I honestly don't remember a lot about her because she left the administration a while ago. I know that when she was there she met with investigators about Russian election meddling. 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow politics and the president? <|endoftext|>  Yes, as much as I can! I try to avoid Twitter mostly.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, did you know that officials in ancient Athens were appointed by a lottery. <|endoftext|>  I did not know that! That is interesting! I did know that elections were being used since the 17th century but I never knew how they did it before then.

 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you have any interest in politics? <|endoftext|>  Hey, No not really. I wish I could, there is just too much corruption in it. Nothing gets done but blaming the other side for everything.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you pay particular attention to politics? <|endoftext|>  I try to, but it seems to be such a hostile subject nowadays.  People seem to not be able to converse without either name calling, or just being nasty.
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about the presidential pardon of the turkey at Thanks Giving ? <|endoftext|>  Apparently, it's a tradition.  I'm happy for the turkeys.Lol

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you agree with Trump that products made in America will make America great again? <|endoftext|>  Hi I would hope so.  Hasn't really been a push for "Made in America" products in the 30 years since the 80s.  
 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever visited the White House? <|endoftext|>  I have not. Have you?
 <|endoftext|>  How do you feel about the MAGA movement? <|endoftext|>  Very negatively. How about you?

 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you watch Fox News at all? <|endoftext|>  I do, mostly because it was created by a Republican media strategist.

 <|endoftext|>  Did you know every president that has had a beard has been a republican?  <|endoftext|>  That's weird.

 <|endoftext|>  Hello. Do you do much traveling? <|endoftext|>  I do, I love to travel. Though I don't think I could do that bus in the Netherlands designed to travel 160 mph.
 <|endoftext|>  do you like cars? <|endoftext|>  I love cars. Did you know in Ohio is illegal to warm them up?
 <|endoftext|>  Jeff Bezos is surely a genius, Amazon is a great company I just love it <|endoftext|>  Me too i think he should run for president.

 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  I know a little bit.  Some odd facts here and there.  Like Lincoln was the first president to be photographed for his inauguration, and John Wilkes Booth was in that photo.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you watch fox news? <|endoftext|>  Not really. I don't watch much TV. You?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how are you doing? Did you watch the White House Correspondents' dinner this year? <|endoftext|>  I did not. I have lost interest in hearing WH correspondents grandstanding. In this partisan environment, I think this tradition should be canceled.

 <|endoftext|>  I have learned that a CNN person thinks that Kellyanne Conway is wrong when she says, "No evidence of collusion"  Big surprise that a CNN person would assert that! <|endoftext|>  Well, I was hoping not to enter into politics, but , I think Kellyane Conway is a politic figure. 
 <|endoftext|>  The president is the function head of the government and the council of ministers.

 <|endoftext|>  Although I can't agree with someone like Jordan Peterson, I can agree that he can be thought provoking in a sense! <|endoftext|>  I do agree that our many computer screens can distract us from the people directly in front of us

 <|endoftext|>  I love going to concerts.  SOmething about a live performance is so much better than listening to a track on your headphones. <|endoftext|>  I used to love going to them, now not so much.

They were the first animal species to be domesticated! <|endoftext|>  I have a feral cat that I feed but I would love to get a dog as well. Domestic animals like dogs were the first species of selectively bred animals. Behaviors, physical attributes and sensory capabilities can all be bred into certain dogs that have a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. All very interesting, indeed. 
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? Do you like baseball? <|endoftext|>  Hello and I think it might be unamerican not to  lol

 <|endoftext|>  Hey! you still buy albums at all? I think they are outdated now. Just like the audio cassette and the vinyl phased out in the 2000's! <|endoftext|>  Yes, the old eight track is not around anymore either. LOL
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, do you follow baseball at all? <|endoftext|>  Hello. Not really. My kids do, their favorite team is the Cubs. I didn't know they were called the Orphans.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Did you feel Boston was right in not inviting Schilling to join the 2004 team at Fenway? I'm a little torn but I agree he what he said about the pipe bomb terrorist was disturbing so I don't blame Boston there! <|endoftext|>  No, I don't either. With all these terrorist. I didn't know baseball managers can play for their teams!

 <|endoftext|>  Hello! How are you tonight? <|endoftext|>  Hi, I am well. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like trousers ? <|endoftext|>  haha well I do, I call them pants though, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, did you know the Zimbabwe's president was called president banana? <|endoftext|>  I do not think I would want to be a president known as president banana!
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that the government owns like 85% of Nevada?? <|endoftext|>  wow that is crazy, the government is weird I guess a rich billionaire bailed them out back in 1895
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I am good but I struggle with the state of our democracy and unwillingness to talk to each other.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello did you know that every president with a bread has been a republican? <|endoftext|>  Oh, yeah, so there's never been a bearded democrat ? I am surprised about that beards were very popular in 1800s. 
 <|endoftext|>  I stayed up so late watching TV last night. There are so many things to watch these days. Did you know there are over 750 episodes of Pokemon?! <|endoftext|>  Yes my queue list is huge.  There are so many shows to watch.  I love watching the Simpsons.

 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you watch tv? <|endoftext|>  Hi yes I watch some TV. Do you use Netflix?
 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you follow celebrities much? <|endoftext|>  I don't actively follow celebrities, but I do find some of them interesting when they pop up in the news in general. I find the notion of celebrity chefs to be kind of ridiculous, though.
 <|endoftext|>  Good Morning! How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Great, what about yourself? do you subscribe to Netflix?
 <|endoftext|>  I use Netflix a lot. Do you use Netflix? <|endoftext|>  I do, too. They have 137 million subscribers!

 <|endoftext|>  Hello. I always like learning more about how things came to be. For example pilgrims clothing was colorful and they wore black for special occasions. <|endoftext|>  That's interesting, I heard Greeks made asbestos clothing.
 <|endoftext|>  I find it neat that football is regional.  Some people think soccer, some people thing rugby.  But the game is still a ball and a opposing team. <|endoftext|>  Cool, do you watch alot of sports?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how's it going? Do you enjoy football? I think it's cool that there's so many variations like Canadian or Australian rules or rugby. <|endoftext|>  I'm a woman so I don't play football or soccer but I love to go to live games to see all the action.  Did you know that Snoop Dogg wrote a fight song for his son's high school football team?  Is that cool or what?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, Are you having a good day? <|endoftext|>  hey, im having a really good day what about you?

 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that Wikileaks published the Government's plans to destroy Wikileaks? I'm guessing that plan didn't pan out so well.  <|endoftext|>  I was thinking the same thing! It definitely did not work out. I think it is cool that the Norwegian govt. donated $1billion to help save the amazon rainforest.
 <|endoftext|>  It looks like the wealthiest presidents in American history JFK, Washington and Jefferson! <|endoftext|>  That's surprising! But not as surprising as facts about Indonesia's president - did you know that they have released 3 pop albums, while in office?

 <|endoftext|>  JFK was among the walthiest presidents of all time. <|endoftext|>  So  have read.  But it is hard to believe that Washington and Jefferson were also. I guess adjusted for  inflation.
 <|endoftext|>  do you know that steven spielberg played the clainet for the soundtrack in Jaws haha? <|endoftext|>  No, I didn't know that. I didn't even think he was musical.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that the first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana? What do you suppose that was about? <|endoftext|>  Maybe it was a nickname. Hopefully it is seen a respectful one and not like some of the names that people have called our past presidents. 
 <|endoftext|>  What's your favorite music from a movie, book, or TV? <|endoftext|>  The soundtrack to JAWS.  Did you know Steven Spielberg played the clarinet in it. Funny, funny stuff.
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going do you watch football? Gridiron, not rugby <|endoftext|>  Yes I like American football
 <|endoftext|>  did you know that Pilgrims actually wore a lot of color and only wore those stereotypical black and white clothes for special occasions <|endoftext|>  That's news to me. did you know that there is a store in alabama that sells clothes, cameras and other stuff left at baggage claim.

 <|endoftext|>  What is your favorite animal? <|endoftext|>  Hi. It's hard to choose. I like so many. I mean, after all there over 7 million different species on the planet.  If I had to pick off the top of my head I would say dogs, horses, and killer whales.  What are your favorites?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I'm doing well. How about you?

 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? <|endoftext|>  I am good.  It is amazing to me how much technology is intertwined in our daily lives.  People cannot live without their Iphones

 <|endoftext|>  do you like cars? <|endoftext|>  I do. DO you know when the drive thru was invented?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know many facts about governments? <|endoftext|>  Some of them, like how the government owns 86% of the land in Nevada, what about you ?
 <|endoftext|>  I recently listened to a podcast and they said the three biggest problems with working from home was th couch, refridgerator, and bed. Do you work from home?  <|endoftext|>  No, unfortunately I can't do that.  It's kinda like the Washington DC situation where there are security concerns about accessing internet with sensitive material.  
 <|endoftext|>  Hi There ! Looking forward to chat with You ! :) <|endoftext|>  Me too. Been in a good mood so hopefully this will be fun!

 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to the radio?  <|endoftext|>  Hello,  yes sometimes,  how about yourself?

 <|endoftext|>  Do you use Facebook? <|endoftext|>  Here and there to find out what people are up to, but I don't really like what a mess it's become. I think it's absurd that 30% of American adults use it as their primary news source.
 <|endoftext|>  Good evening <|endoftext|>  Good evening.  Do you Jupiter has radio storms that can be picked up and heard by am radion
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I'm good!  Are you a fan of dramas?

 <|endoftext|>  Hello!  Are you a basketball fan? <|endoftext|>  I love basketball, how about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Basketball season seems to be getting exciting.  Good game with the Wizards and the CLippers the other day. They won after being down. See the game? <|endoftext|>  I didn't, but heard something about it. I believe it was the first game where Beal and Wall each scored 20 points in a half as teammates.
 <|endoftext|>  I never was big into playing basketball, but I loved to watch it.  Especially people like Kareem Abdul Jabbar and his dunks. <|endoftext|>  Yes, me too! Did you know that dunking was band for 10 years since Kareem had such a dominant dunk and game play.
 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you watch NBA? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I love to watch basketball.  How about you?

 <|endoftext|>  Interesting, John Wicks who is a U.K. pop genius once called Virginia home.  <|endoftext|>  Don't think I've ever heard of him. Did you know that Myspace turned down an offer to buy Facebook for $75 million in early 2005?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, are you by any chance an NBA fan, and if so, what's your favorite team? <|endoftext|>  I dont really have a favorite team anymore. I jut like to watch it sometimes. I think the NBA has the best athletes of any sport in the world.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you a fan of college sports? I remember from that movie, Rudy, that Villanova University has a really intense football team and culture surrounding it. <|endoftext|>  well I like professional stuff more personally, likeI think its funny the dunk was banned in the NBA for a while

 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  Do you watch basketball? <|endoftext|>  Yea, I'm a huge knicks fan but follow the other 29 teams in the NBA, you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, it is crazy to find out that either a college football and basketball coach get a high pay. <|endoftext|>  There's television revenue and the alumni want winning teams. Consider that Stan van Gundy was fined for saying something that would lower $$$ for the NBA.
 <|endoftext|>  Are You an NBA fan ? <|endoftext|>  Not really, but Porter played well in the 4th quarter for the Wizards.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like basketball?  <|endoftext|>  I do like it and have a passing familiarity

Have you ever watched House? <|endoftext|>  WOW... that is hard to believe!  Yes, i have seen House, it's a pretty awesome show!  You ever listened to the old radio dramas?  Apparently you can listen to them for free!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you know who John Wicks is? <|endoftext|>  An alternative pop star born in the UK!

 <|endoftext|>  We definitely need gun control.  The mass shootings like in Thousand Oaks are out of control. <|endoftext|>  Ban assault rifles if you must, but don't touch my bazooka. That's my mode. In fact, I wrote a country song to that effect.

 <|endoftext|>  Do you watch TV or Youtube more? <|endoftext|>  I watch Youtube more which is also the second largest search engine on the internet.

 <|endoftext|>  Hello.  Probably this fact is before Trump, but the three wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington and Jefferson <|endoftext|>  Hey, it takes a lot of money to get elected!  Campaigns are expensive.  Did you know up until 1905, the runner up would become Vice President?  I can imagine all the fighting that would have caused!
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, have you ever experienced a hurricane before?  I have. <|endoftext|>  I haven't, which one have you experienced?
 <|endoftext|>  Howdy Partner! <|endoftext|>  hi. do you like country music?
 <|endoftext|>  wow did you know that Country music legend george strait and the wealthiest man in the world jeff bezos are cousins.? <|endoftext|>  Very interesting, I didn't know that. But country was the most listened to genre in rush hour radio in 2009.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Hello there, I am well thank you.  How are you today?
 <|endoftext|>  I didn't know that 86% of the land in Nevada was owned by the U.S. government, crazy! <|endoftext|>  I had no idea. That is almost the whole state.  TaIking about weird stuff I found it crazy that a man sold the Eiffel tower twice
 <|endoftext|>  Interesting that migrants stay with Catholic Charities on the border, and they let them watch things like Disney movies on TV <|endoftext|>  Do they let them stay there because they dont feel that they are dangerous?

 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to read? <|endoftext|>  I do. Do you?

 <|endoftext|>  Did you know reading is the complex cognitive process of decoding symbols such as letters to get a meaning? <|endoftext|>  i never really thought of it that way but it makes sense.
 <|endoftext|>  I've always enjoyed reading. How about yourself? <|endoftext|>  Hi! I have to some extent but I can see why people find it boring, at least books can be interpreted differently by each person which makes them interesting,

 <|endoftext|>  I'm a big fan of Facebook. Do you use it much? <|endoftext|>  A few times a week.  The company's HQ is located near where I used to live.  Menlo Park.
 <|endoftext|>  did you know that the united states got thrid place in the world cup back in 1930 <|endoftext|>  Hi! No I did not, are you a soccer fan?
 <|endoftext|>  hi. i love watching sports on tv , my absolute favorite to watch is the World Cup <|endoftext|>  I am a huge fan as well - but we are in good company - 3.2 billion people watched the 2010 cup
 <|endoftext|>  I think it's great that woman are getting a chance to show they can be sports announcers. <|endoftext|>  I agree.  It interesting how we are so used to males and females playing certain roles.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like soccer? <|endoftext|>  It's okay.  I usually watch some of the world cup when it's on.  You?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I am doing well, how about yourself?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy watching soccer? I'm surprised it's not more popular in the US since it's played by 250 million people in the world. <|endoftext|>  I don't actually but I don't like many sports. Yeah, I guess we are the only weird country. Soccer makes more money than most all other major sports combined

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, are you a football fan? <|endoftext|>  Hi! I am , i love football. Are you referring to soccer or american football? I like both. Football can mean so many different things... association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. 
 <|endoftext|>  I'm surprised to read that MLS cannot find a suitable venue for DC United to play its home opener at.  Given how much money soccer makes world wide, you would think they have a good arena for them. <|endoftext|>  It makes more than every other sport combined. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you doing over there? <|endoftext|>  I'm great! Thanks! How are you today? It's a bit windy here but beautiful nonetheless!

 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, are you into soccer at all? The fifa world cup was started back in 1930 <|endoftext|>  I do like soccer. I just found out that the city for the 2022 World Cup still needs to be built
 <|endoftext|>  Do you use the internet often? <|endoftext|>  I do! I was just reading on the internet about the story about Alex Jones Facebook page being taken down....
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like football? <|endoftext|>  I know very little about football. I do know about the team the patriots and Tom Brady. I recently learned of a player on that team that has never fumbled a ball.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  Do you follow world cup soccer? <|endoftext|>  Not really, how about you? Maybe I should follow the American women's team as they have not placed below third place since the start of the world cup in 1991.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Do you like soccer? <|endoftext|>  I love soccer, its one of my passions, did you watch the FIFA World Cup last year?

 <|endoftext|>  HOw's it going, do you follow football? The university of Iowa has a pink lockerroom for visiting teams <|endoftext|>  Yes, I follow football somewhat.  I guess that's to psych out the opposing team.  lol. Did you know that back in the 1960's top bowlers made twice as much as top football players?  My, how times have changed.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you have any interest in FIFA? <|endoftext|>  personally I don't haha, I don' watch sports but I guess the world cup will be in 2022 in Qatar, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello do you like football? <|endoftext|>  it can be fun to watch and is the most popular sport
 <|endoftext|>  Do you watch football? <|endoftext|>  As in Soccer? Not too often. usually during the world cup. Do you?
 <|endoftext|>  Man, I love football how about you? <|endoftext|>  It depends, are you talking about American football or what the rest of the world rightfully calls football?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like facebook? <|endoftext|>  I actully hate it. to easy for people to spread lies. Much like Alex Jones
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to use the internet?  It seems like I'm constantly using it. <|endoftext|>  Yes it feels like I am always online as well. Do you use Facebook?

 <|endoftext|>  Jos Roozen seems like quite a guy, a lot of knowledge about plants and gardening indeed. <|endoftext|>  yes I think he developed an interest in saltwater fish of all things, saltwater fish actually drink water through their mouth while freshwater fish absorb water through their skin
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there!  Do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  I do, what about you? 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you listen to the radio much? <|endoftext|>  I do. Im learning latin. And theres a finnish station that broadcast "nuntii latini" weekly
 <|endoftext|>  Trump and intensity, they sure go by the hand <|endoftext|>  Unfortunately they do. What do you think the worst thing he has done so far?
 <|endoftext|>  I have always wanted to tour the White House.  There is so much history there, ever since John Adams starting living there in 1800 <|endoftext|>  Agreed, I was there once long ago. Adams may have been president!

 <|endoftext|>  Where is the White House located? <|endoftext|>  1600 Pennsylvania Ave... Why do you ask?
 <|endoftext|>  Wow, more Trump bashing, how novel. I just was gagging reading an article, "Has Trump finally gone to far?"  I my opinion, it's the biased press that's going too far. <|endoftext|>  I agree, The news is so upsetting.
 <|endoftext|>  Good Morning! I'm not much interested in the White House, but I do root for President Trump <|endoftext|>  So do I.  I hope he succeeds with some of his initiatives.  I wonder if he'll want to take the solar panels off the back of the white house that George Bush had installed.
 <|endoftext|>  Greetings!  <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you doing?
 <|endoftext|>  How do you feel about boarder security and the fact families are being separated at the boarder? <|endoftext|>  That is a difficult issue since mistreatment of children is sad and may be comparable to what happened in Nazi concentration camps when you see that  2000 kids were taken from their families 
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going? Are you interested in past US Presidents? During Teddy Roosevelt's presidency christmas trees were banned from the white house <|endoftext|>  He did? that sounds like something the Grinch would do lol, I think its important to follow politics.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know the GOP was liberal until Barry Goldwater in 1964. <|endoftext|>  I did not know that. Very interesting. There hasn't been a president who wasn't a republican or a democrat since 1853.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you comfortable talking about the government? <|endoftext|>  For sure. They are everywhere after all. Even on WIkileaks pages

 <|endoftext|>  do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  Some stuff. DO you know who the wealthiest three are?
 <|endoftext|>  Good Evening. I was just reading about radios made with a pencil and a razor blade. I would like to see that done! <|endoftext|>  Ya that does sound interesting! I thought it was funny that canadian law has 40% of all music played required to be canadian haha
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a Linkin Park fan?  They are great. They played 324 concerts in 2001. I still can´t believe it. <|endoftext|>  I am I think they are one of the best bands ever, too bad the leading singer committed suicide, maybe the toll of many concerts made him fall into depression. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you?? <|endoftext|>  Im great, so what are your thoughts on Trumps Ex Lawyer, I think Trump is guilty.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there! Have you heard about the crazy things President Duterte has been doing to the media in the Philippines recently? <|endoftext|>  Yeah Ive heard, seems like freedom of the press is coming to an end in the Philippines, he denounced all mayor news outlets there. 
 <|endoftext|>  Michael Cohen said he was in contact with Russians to build a Trump hotel in Moscow during the 2016 campaign. <|endoftext|>  Hi. He did-what happened?
 <|endoftext|>  This is fairly interesting to me because the history of "President" as the name for a chief of state is something I researched years ago. <|endoftext|>  yes indeed. Would you like to share some interesting stuff you learned?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi.  <|endoftext|>  Hello how are you? Interesting article about soybeans.

 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you know the website wikileaks? <|endoftext|>  Yea, it publishes top secret stuff and the US government wants to stop it
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that, according to Canadian law, 40% of the music on the radio must be by Canadian artists? That would explain why Drake is so popular.  <|endoftext|>  No I didn't actually it seems like that might be the case for Justin Bieber as well his song 'baby' is the most disliked video on youtube
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house? <|endoftext|>  I had heard that.  I think the guest house is newer.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey have you ever been to a concert? <|endoftext|>  Lots! Lucky to have come from a family that was very into music. Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concert in 2001? That seems like a crazy schedule.

 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about the Niger protests? <|endoftext|>  They seem to be getting worse. What's your opinion?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, are you particularly interested in politics? <|endoftext|>  I am about average in my interest in politics. Although, I do find it interesting that we have not had a President since 1853 that wasn't Republican or Democrat.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow the government? <|endoftext|>  Sometimes I do, sometimes not. What about you? 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi do you like using Youtube? <|endoftext|>  I do like the YouTube page I found there are some  interesting videos on the site, what about you? do you like it?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like music? <|endoftext|>  Very much. I don't go to concerts though. For some reason (with a few exceptions) I think of the studio version of a song as the "real" version and hate the crowd noise in live versions. Are you a concert-goer?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house? <|endoftext|>  I have heard this fact. I don't know how Donald J Trump lives with it. He would resent the unfairness of the situation.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there! Do you enjoy live music? <|endoftext|>  Hi, I do when I have the chance yes! I like piano jazz. There was one on the Airship Hindenburg that was made of aluminum and only weighed 356 pounds!
 <|endoftext|>  You ever been to the Phillipines? <|endoftext|>  I have not, have you?

 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever read Neon Lion? <|endoftext|>  I haven't. I heard it's a children's story about standing out from the crowd?
 <|endoftext|>  Mass shootings have become a political football.  Guns vs. No Guns... I think the problem is deeper than that. <|endoftext|>  I agree, but there should be a bigger control  guns are our rights but filters must be applied
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  I've heard that the top three wealthiest presidents are JFK, Washington and Jefferson. I think that has to account for inflation though.

 <|endoftext|>  Hello,  do you watch football? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do watch football I love the Patriots what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  I think as far as players go Tom Brady is way overrated.  <|endoftext|>  His wife, Gisele Bundchen, makes more than double her husband's salary. Maybe the Pats should hire her, LOL. Do you think he has succeeded because of his coach, Bill B?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello lets talk about quarterbacks, there is only one left handed quarterback in the NFL and it is Kellan moore <|endoftext|>  In NFL, Quarterback are required to wear uniform number between 1 and 19. In modern American football, the quarterback are member of offensive team.

 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever heard of the NBA player LeBron James? I've only seen him on television. <|endoftext|>  yes, he was born in 1984, hes one of the best players in the NBA, do you watch basketball?

 <|endoftext|>  I wonder how the 160 mph Dutch commuter bus works -- like is it mostly automated on an invisible track? And is it on a fenced-in right-of-way to avoid hitting people? <|endoftext|>  I would venture to guess that there are many safety protocals for that commmuter bus. if it were to hit  somebody it would cost them millions.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  I didn't know that there was a type of soccer where three teams play at once.  Wonder how that works? <|endoftext|>  Fascinating.  I imagine the better two of the teams would just try to put it past the weakest defense.  Or maybe the scoring is different?

 <|endoftext|>  It's funny that That 70s Show scripts were reshot in the UK -- Sanford Son and Three's Company were literal copies of British TV shows in American settings. <|endoftext|>  They were canceled after 10 episodes. This is so sad.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi! It's crazy to think the three wealthiest presidents in US history were Jefferson, JFK and Washington! <|endoftext|>  Yeah you would think some of the more modern ones would be on there as well. 
 <|endoftext|>  The internet has became the king of the world these days. <|endoftext|>  That was inevitable. This is the information age. I am surprised only 7% of people read the terms of service.

 <|endoftext|>  He there! It's football season! Did you know Tom Brady's wife makes more than he does? <|endoftext|>  Really? That's amazing considering how popular her is. The Patriots have been the focus of some mysterious situations, apparently. 
 <|endoftext|>  So apparently this Butler guy stole a jersey it seems? <|endoftext|>  What a jerk, I am a big football fan.  Did you know that Tom Brady was picked in the 6th Round, at number 199 in the 2000 NFL draft?
 <|endoftext|>  did You know that wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy wikileaks ? <|endoftext|>  That makes sense.  They probably did it while Trump was thinking about those pesky migrant caravans.

 <|endoftext|>  hey there, what are your thoughts on our currernt Government? <|endoftext|>  I don't trust the government. i feel like there are too many secrets and things going on behind the scenes for me to form an accurate opinion.

 <|endoftext|>  Did you hear about the trial with Adidas and the NCAA <|endoftext|>  I did hear about it, I guess Adidas is accused of defrauding colleges, what do you think about that?
 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever broken a thumb? <|endoftext|>  Hello, I have not. Have you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello how are you doing? Do you like basketball?  I was just reading some cool facts! Kareem abdul-jabbar's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade. <|endoftext|>  Hello!

 <|endoftext|>  Prince William crime report!  I thought the British royals stayed out of the crime business? <|endoftext|>  I have read the same thing, it is a report of the crimes that happened in Prince William county for a period of time. If it is a "hot" county, it is better than TV. 
 <|endoftext|>  hello <|endoftext|>  Hi. Holy heck, the crime report for Prince William is lit today. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello do you like to talk about television? <|endoftext|>  I'll talk abut anything, television, dogs, Prince William County, just not football, I've had enough football.

 <|endoftext|>  Do you watch a lot of news programs? I find that they focus too much on the negative sometimes, it can make you depressed. <|endoftext|>  I don't really watch them but I agree with you. They seem to focus on drama and making people tense and afraid.  I've watched some Fox News knowing it has a republican bias but I have found that it is sometimes more balanced and unbiased in it's approach.

 <|endoftext|>  Hey how are you doing, do you have kids that watch Sesame Street? <|endoftext|>  I used to love watching Sesame Street myself! How about you? I was surprised to find out Caroll Spinney was the performer behind both Big Bird as well as Oscar the Grouch!
 <|endoftext|>  hello how are you doing? Reggie miller, nba hall of famer, couldn't escape his older sister cheryl's shadow while in high school. on january 26, 1982, he scored a career high 40 points. he tried bragging about it on the car ride home, only to find out cheryl scored 105 points and broken 8 national records! <|endoftext|>  Yes, and do you like Basketball?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello.  Have you ever been to South Africa? <|endoftext|>  I have not. Have you?
 <|endoftext|>  I love the internet. Its a huge connection of computers and networks <|endoftext|>  Do you spend more time on the internet or on your television watching televised programming?
 <|endoftext|>  Good afternoon.  Are you a basketball fan? <|endoftext|>  Yes I am, are you? What do you think of Billy Preston?
 <|endoftext|>  did you know that dogs have 12 different blood types? <|endoftext|>  I have a dog, I wonder what type of blood he has, I didnt know he could have 12 different types.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to watch car races? <|endoftext|>  I do not really watch car races. Do you? Are they good?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Do you like television? <|endoftext|>  It's ok, don't really watch much of it.
 <|endoftext|>  What type of entertainment do you enjoy? <|endoftext|>  I like reading book, watching tv (films and shows), exercising, cooking and if I have time left I play video games or browse the internet. And you ?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to watch basketball? <|endoftext|>  Sometimes, usually just the playoffs. I'm surprised Air Jordans were banned tho!
 <|endoftext|>  The national basketball association sets rules for players pay and a draft to ensure that teams are roughly equal. <|endoftext|>  I think thats a good thing, do you follow the NBA?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like basketball? I read that Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's dominant use of the dunk got the shot banned from college basketball for over a decade. <|endoftext|>  I bet. Kareem was a beast on the court. Gheorghe Muresan was one of the tallest players in the NBA. He was 7'7.
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning! How are you? <|endoftext|>  Good, how are you doing?  
 <|endoftext|>  Do you watch tv shows? On tv or internet? <|endoftext|>  I only watch on TV.  I do stream some but I still put them on my smart TV rather than a computer.  I use the LED technology but if I had a smaller screen I would use OLED.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Pretty well. How are you?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a dog lover? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I am. I love dogs! How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy using the internet? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I do! How are you?

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  hi i'm good, did you know that airplane travelling is ten percent slower than it was in the 1960's?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy travel?  If so, what is your preferred way to travel (e.g., bus, car, and airplane)? <|endoftext|>  I love to travel. I actually have my pilot's license so my favorite method is hands down a plane :D   Possibly I'm related to King Kalakaua from Hawaii with my desire to travel near and far? 
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you travel? <|endoftext|>  I do, both for work and business. I'm usually always on the go. I wish I had that commuter bus that the Dutch are creating that goes 160mph.
 <|endoftext|>  My favorite nfl team, the Ravens, lost yesterday.  Their QB play was terrible. <|endoftext|>  Yeah, I was surprised to see him do so poorly. I wanted them to win too
 <|endoftext|>  Hello,  did you know the President of Indonesia made 3 pop albums?  He sounds like a fun president,  concerts and after parties all the time lol  <|endoftext|>  Yes I heard that exact comment before.  What did you think about the summit between Trump and Kim?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of the NBA? <|endoftext|>  I am, how about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you think that politics is better or worse for having switched to a system where the vice-president runs with the president instead of being the runner up?   <|endoftext|>  I think it is worse because the runner up is no longer involved.  What do you think?
 <|endoftext|>  Too bad the CEO of Mathas Table is stepping down, quality will be lost there for sure <|endoftext|>  Only 6 years ago did she take the helm of the dc food pantry!
 <|endoftext|>  hey my friend do you have amazon Prime? <|endoftext|>  Hi, there. Yes, in fact I love my Amazon Prime because I get free shipping plus much more. Amazon is an amazing company.

 <|endoftext|>  Do you think that Patty Stonesifer is making the right call? <|endoftext|>  I know she is CEO of a company, but am not sure which one.
 <|endoftext|>  How often do you use Amazon, if at all? <|endoftext|>  I've used it a lot this past month.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  hey did you know that a creed concert was so horrible that people filed a lawsuit against them? <|endoftext|>  Lol no, but I'm not surprised that creed's concert was that bad that they got sued
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there do you like dramatic movies? <|endoftext|>  oh I love them, it's my second favorite movie type after comedy.  I love to be an actor someday, The highest paid actor is Laugh Laurie, He earned $700000 for episode of the House. That was a brilliant show too.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Im great, do you like Christian films?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that the second largest website is Youtube due to the net worth? <|endoftext|>  Wow, that is surprising.  It makes sense because it gets a lot of traffic and Google has been able to develop it.  Do you know who founded the company or where it is located?
 <|endoftext|>  Merry Christmas!  I have a day off coming soon and want to watch some television.  Do you have any recommendations? <|endoftext|>  Id would definitely recommend South Park
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, did you know the president's guest house is larger than the White House? <|endoftext|>  Hi, Yes I did. I learned that on a trip to DC where I toured the White House. They didn't let us in the guest house though.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! Did you know the white house has twin buildings in France and Ireland? <|endoftext|>  I heard that! I guess people in those countries admire that aspect of the US. i would love to visit.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of baseball?  <|endoftext|>  I  am a fan of the game, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  hey hows it going? <|endoftext|>  Im good I was reading about how these three men got arrested trying to breach the white house.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Are you a baseball fan? <|endoftext|>  Yes I am what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! I was happy to see the late passengers of Flight 93 who died on 9/11 receive praise from the president! <|endoftext|>  Yeah. I read the 9/11 commision report and cried while reading it due to those heros.
 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever visited the white house <|endoftext|>  I have not, have you?  I hears the president guest house is bigger than the white house.
 <|endoftext|>  The White House sure has a long history! <|endoftext|>  It does! There are a lot of interesting things about it
 <|endoftext|>  Hi - do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  I do. Do you know a lot about them?
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning! Dp you think Trump will join the richest presidents? <|endoftext|>  I do not think so. What do you think?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like concerts? <|endoftext|>  i do, but i dont really have the time or money to go these days. i used to go a lot. what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know Linkin Park played 324 concerts in 2001.  <|endoftext|>  That's unreal,  I guess they had only two places to be either on stage or on the tour bus; no time for anything else.  While concerts are generally loud, some are louder than others. Did you know the Foo Fighters did a concert in New Zealand that was so loud it was picked up on seismic monitors?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, are you into cars, radios, or clothing? <|endoftext|>  I love cars. Do you know how Cadillac got its name?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, How are you? <|endoftext|>  Hello, I am good.  How are you?  Did you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there what do you know about the White House? <|endoftext|>  I know that the Guest House is bigger than the white house. 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy cars? <|endoftext|>  I lease a car but I do not own a car and I don't care too much for cars. I am very interested in sociopolitical events, though, and I am deeply saddened to hear of the news that Detective Jacai Colson was killed under friendly fire. Did you hear about this?
 <|endoftext|>  An undercover detective holding his badge and shouting "police, police" was shot and killed by police in Maryland. <|endoftext|>  Cat-like reflexes, trained to perform at the highest level, equipped with the finest weapons and trained to distinguish between friend and foe...did this to a fellow law enforcement professional. This is dangerous work with genuine risk. My hearts go out to all involved. Were there flame throwers involved? If this was South Africa, cars can legally be equipped with those.  Talk about deterrent!
 <|endoftext|>  So what do you think about president trump? <|endoftext|>  I'm not a fan of the way he is going about things but I respect the office of president. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I'm great! How are you?
 <|endoftext|>  I got an interesting article about Trump, <|endoftext|>  Oh?  What's he saying now?
 <|endoftext|>  I wonder what the media would say about Teddy Rosevelt and Quincy Adams not using a Bible at their inaugurals today <|endoftext|>  They would probably applaud for the most part.  I find it amazing that Jefferson cut out the supernatural parts of the Bible.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, what do you prefer? Republics or Kingdoms? <|endoftext|>  I would prefer a republic. There is an election of representatives.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello,  how are you ? The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana <|endoftext|>  I am well. That's pretty funny! The top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson
 <|endoftext|>  Interesting to learn more about Tondo. There population of 200,000 people or more <|endoftext|>  I believe that is in Manila and is a slum. Many of the residents live in 50-square-foot shacks which I cannot imagine. 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you have an Apple computer? <|endoftext|>  I don't, but I use an Iphone. Why? 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Hope you're having a good day. Have you been following all the drama around Michael Cohen?? <|endoftext|>  No, who is he? 
 <|endoftext|>  The ACLU claims to not support either political party.  Huge lie.  The ACLU is so left it is totally in bed with democrats.  The want control of how Comey's private files are reviewed. <|endoftext|>  Did you know monaco eliminated income tax in 1869?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the government?  <|endoftext|>  No, I did not. That is crazy. I usually do not think of the government as land owners. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you use facebook? <|endoftext|>  I do!  Wish I had created it.  I would probably be super rich now.  lol
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there do you use Facebook? What do you think about Mark Zuckerberg? <|endoftext|>  I think that he is a dude who is in charge of a massively different product that he anticipated
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Do you use facebook? <|endoftext|>  I do not use Facebook. It has poor policies about privacy. Do you use Facebook?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello. Do you use Facebook? <|endoftext|>  Hello there, I do and use it about once a day.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Good Morning! How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Good morning. I'm great thank you. Do you follow politics?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy traveling? <|endoftext|>  Hello there, I do, but don't get to go as much as I would like to.  How about yourself?
 <|endoftext|>  I spend a lot of time on YouTube. How about you? <|endoftext|>  I spend a little time on it looking at how to videos. What do you watch?
 <|endoftext|>  I got so angry when I heard about that black man getting arrested <|endoftext|>  I feel the same way. I don't know how they could smell marijuana in his pocket.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  I do, usually while driving.  Nothing like that Finnish station which broadcasts in classical Latin though.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, have you watched the series 13 Reasons Why? <|endoftext|>  I have not, have you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you use television for entertainment? <|endoftext|>  no, I am more into streaming. I really like Netflix.
 <|endoftext|>  Wow I wonder why Orange is the new black is so noteworthy. I have never seen one episode, have you? <|endoftext|>  I have, I like it, too bad the series got cancelled.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you have a favorite Netflix show? They've come so far since Lilyhammer. <|endoftext|>  Honestly, the subscription is worth it just for the OFfice sometimes. Did you know they account for 33% of all bandwidth at night?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you like television? <|endoftext|>  I like it, some shows more than others.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Netflix is an American media service found in 1997 by Reed hastings and Marc randolph. <|endoftext|>  That's quite interesting. Do you have a Netflix subscription?
 <|endoftext|>  Have you heard about the Orange is the New Black Cancellation?  They are cancelling after seven seasons. <|endoftext|>  i guess they ran out of stories. i dont really know the show. seven seasons? that is a good run.
 <|endoftext|>  Have you watched "13 Reasons Why" on Netflix? <|endoftext|>  I have not, but lets talk about Netflix. They spend a lot of money on postage, even more then bandwidth 
 <|endoftext|>  So Mo'Nique is boycotting Netflix? <|endoftext|>  Yea, I guess she wanted more money.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey!  Wach any good Netflix movies lately? <|endoftext|>  I did not watch 13 reasons why, but i do like Jessica Jones
 <|endoftext|>  Hi. Do you watch Netflix? <|endoftext|>  Hi. I used to.  Do you watch Netflix?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there do you ever watch Netflix? I love Netflix that I watched it today actually haha <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? I used to watch Netflix. It's gotten so popular.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello do you watch TV? <|endoftext|>  I do watch tv. What about you, do you watch tv?
 <|endoftext|>  do you watch tv? <|endoftext|>  I do quite a bit. Do you watch the SNL?

 <|endoftext|>  Good morning - I love baseball and can't wait for spring training to start! <|endoftext|>  Hello there!  I am the same, my team had one of the best seasons they have ever had so I'm excited as well!

 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy baseball? <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Yes, I enjoy baseball. I usually try to watch the World Series.
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning! How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Im great, do you like baseball?
 <|endoftext|>  What physical means does the telephone use to transmit sound? <|endoftext|>  Im not sure what it means what Im surprised by is the power of the Iphone
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  hey I'm good, did you know that dolphins can communicate though phones and understand each otehr?
 <|endoftext|>  do you like drama? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do. Did you know JOn Hamm was a high school teacher for drama
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Good!  How often do you use the internet?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that 80% of the earth's natural forests are destroyed already? <|endoftext|>  That is so sad considering we humans would only represent a minute and seventeen seconds if we viewed its history as a 24 hour period. And we've already destroyed so much it.
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you know much about the earth? <|endoftext|>  I know that we as humans are not doing a good job of taking care of it, we have already destroyed 80% of the natural forests.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, are you particularly interested in politics? <|endoftext|>  I try to stay out of politics but unfortunately I do get sucked into it sometimes haha. I did see that Wikileaks was going to be destroyed by the US government apparently, and then Wikileaks leak that plan haha that's so crazy
 <|endoftext|>  hey my friend do you watch TV? <|endoftext|>  I do like watching TV, do you have any favorite shows?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Can you believe the three wealthiest presidents of all time were Jefferson, Washington and JFK? <|endoftext|>  Hi! Washington and jFK makes sense, this is probably a bit out of date (i.e., Trump). The president of indonesia released 3 pop albums in office. Multi talented!
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning!  Do you like to play any video games? <|endoftext|>  I do, its one of my favorite activities, do you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey! <|endoftext|>  How are you today?
 <|endoftext|>  Theres a store in alabama that sells items left at airports <|endoftext|>  Wouldn't that be fun to go to?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you watch a lot of tele or tv? <|endoftext|>  hey there, dI do watch some, have you ever watched Pokemon?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello Friend.  Do you want to talk about clothing?  Did you know that Pilgrim clothing was full of color and that they only wore black for special occasions?  Doesn't that seem strange? <|endoftext|>  I guess people dont like the normal. the abnormal makes for interesting narrative. the pilgrims were just folks like you and me. 
 <|endoftext|>  What type of entertainment do you enjoy? <|endoftext|>  Hi, I enjoy quite a few different things. Tops on my list is probably video games. I read that in total the planet plays about 3 billion hours of video games a week.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Good morning; I am doing great today thank you for asking!
 <|endoftext|>  Episcopal is a private boarding school in Alexandria with a lot of diversity. <|endoftext|>  Yes I have heard that it is a very beautiful school. Are you familiar with David Zeng by chance?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there, do you like the NFL games <|endoftext|>  Hi there I sure do. Did you know snoop dogg wrote a song for his son's school team?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know what the highest scoring football game was? <|endoftext|>  No, 150-ish  ?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello and good morning. You a basketball fan? I used to play a lot. I like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar he was very dominant. His dunk was crazy. <|endoftext|>  Yes I am a basketball fan. I follow the NBA more than I follow college basketball. Who is your favorite team?
 <|endoftext|>  There are so very odd facts about the united states government. I wonder if the same can be said for other countries.  <|endoftext|>  I'm sure there is. I find it odd that every US president with a beard has been Republican. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! Do you have a favorite football team? <|endoftext|>  hi, how are you? no i dont. i dont really know the sport well. You?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  Do you follow the government? <|endoftext|>  A little the Republican party is also called the GOP.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there! <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you know Paul Manafort, former Trump campain chairman
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? What do you think of government? <|endoftext|>  I like it but do not like some of the players. You?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you consume the news a lot? <|endoftext|>  Not really. I don't like all the negativity although I am guilty of getting news form social media like facebook.
 <|endoftext|>  What are your thoughs on media? <|endoftext|>  I think it's very important for people to stay informed and also as equally important to not be biased by what you see and that certain publications are biased vs others, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning! Are you a fan of football? <|endoftext|>  Good morning. Yes. which is your favourite football team ?
 <|endoftext|>  do you like the band Kiss? I like them a lot, I guess they bought into an arena football team <|endoftext|>  I do enjoy their music.  I think its cool that they offered a contract to Tim Tebow to play.
 <|endoftext|>  Have you heard that Trump is apparently worried over the Manafort trial? It's been in the news lately. <|endoftext|>  Yeah, Paul Manafort is quite the character, as is Trump. Trump was evidently quoted saying he didn't understand why the government didn't tell him Manafort was under investigation.
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about the company Trump keeps like Paul manafort? <|endoftext|>  I think it is questionable.  Obviously the problem is two-fold for Trump.  The types he associates with and when he endorses someone, that stamp of approval does not mean much.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you a football fan? <|endoftext|>  I watch some football on occasion.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Do you follow the government at all? I find it awfully ironic that Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy them. Ha! <|endoftext|>  I've always followed the government closely. Unfortunately it's become a reality show lately so it's been even easier to follow. Ha - Assange is never getting out of Ecuador.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like football? <|endoftext|>  Yes, college mainly. Did you know the U. of Iowa has a pink locker room for the visiting team?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy sports? <|endoftext|>  Yeah, for the most part. Do you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you have an interest in politics? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do, why are Americans so hard on president Trump?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow politics? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I dont like Trump, how about you?
 <|endoftext|>  "The mistrust of the media is so extreme among Republicans that 40 percent consider otherwise accurate news stories to be "fake news" if the stories cast a politician or political group in a negative light. " I find that number to be really more than I thought... <|endoftext|>  Do you think the news is fake?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello,  hows it going?  did you know the Presidents guest house is bigger than the white house?  That is crazy! <|endoftext|>  I did hear that. pomp and circumstance. Apparently the president of Indonesia has 3 pop album. 
 <|endoftext|>  Iowa's guest locker room for football teams is painted pink, hilarious! <|endoftext|>  LOL.  I know all about it being a Nebraska fan who has had teams play there!  Are you a fan of football?
 <|endoftext|>  do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  I know some stuff. DO you know who are the three wealthiest us presidents?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you get a lot of news from the media? <|endoftext|>  I try to stick with larger media outlets.  I follow news aggregators, like Drudge and then for issues I am interested, I get info from different sources to weed out biases.  Media is still important but needs to report more and opine less.  I think that's the gist of the Gallup poll.  Your thoughts?
 <|endoftext|>  Episcopal High School is great for learning football and bonding as a team.  It is very diverse as well. <|endoftext|>  Yeah I heard it is a good school.  I guess the student population there is 445. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello. How are you? <|endoftext|>  Hey!  I am doing well, enjoying my Sunday.  How are you?  Getting ready to watch some college basketball this afternoon.  The brainchild of James Naismith! Are you a fan?
 <|endoftext|>  I was sad to see that Charlotte Rae died.  I loved the show The Facts of Life when I was young <|endoftext|>  I've never seen a show but I did hear good things. She actually was nominated for an Emmy for her work on Broadway which I think is cool
 <|endoftext|>  Hello do you enjoy watching the telly? <|endoftext|>  I don't watch so much now. I use the computer mostly. You?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you watch The Facts of Life?  <|endoftext|>  Yeah I though it was a great show, too bad Charlotte Rae did although she was old.
 <|endoftext|>  I can't believe ABC brought back Last Man Standing. <|endoftext|>  I have never seen it.  I don't really watch much TV
 <|endoftext|>  Hey! Did you hear that actress Charlotte Rae passed, she was the house mother on the factss of Life, so sad. <|endoftext|>  It is sad. She did have a long life though. She lived to 92. I hope I make it that long.

 <|endoftext|>  Humans are amazing! we have evolved into smart species.  <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? we are a very smart species. we dont have much hair though!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  Im a human, yet there are so many facts about being human I didnt even know!  how about you? <|endoftext|>  That is true.     Humans are the only current members of Hominina.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello,  did you know humans have a defective gene and cannot produce our own vitamin c? <|endoftext|>  I heard that before, even though most plants and animals make their own vitamin C.  Did you hear that there is a certain sound frequency that causes fear in humans? I wonder what it is?
 <|endoftext|>  The White House is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. and has been there since 1800 and I have never been.  Have you? <|endoftext|>  I've never been, though I want to go.The White House seems behind the curve technologically. W. had solar panels put back on the White House. Reagan had them taken off. I wonder why Clinton didn’t put them back on. Floppy disks? I wonder if they have laser printers yet. Or mice. 
 <|endoftext|>  Good day. Do you follow politics? <|endoftext|>  I do.  It is hard not to follow it nowadays.  The president is always in the news
 <|endoftext|>  I didn't know that The top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson <|endoftext|>  Neither did I, I wouldn't have guessed it was them. I've also never heard that until 1805 the runner up in the presidential election became V.P. Do you think they should bring this back?

 <|endoftext|>  Hi. Have you heard of Chris Rock's show "Tambourine"? <|endoftext|>  I did hear about that show, that's his new one right? I think the tour before this was called "Total Blackout" right
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a Chris Rock fan? <|endoftext|>  I am not. However, I do have a lot of respect for him, for owning up to his faults as a husband, and bringing porn addiction into the light.

 <|endoftext|>  This is one of those rummors I had heard about prior to Hannibel Burress and it made me so sad. This and the Clippers owner being racist were both really sad.  <|endoftext|>  The Clippers owner and the Bill Cosby accusations are both disgusting and sad. They both need to be put away for a long time
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like hockey ? <|endoftext|>  I have passing knowledge of hockey, but to say I like it would be gong to far.

 <|endoftext|>  Did you hear about that Canadian billionaire and his wife that was murdered? <|endoftext|>  No, I did not. Was it recently?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that in new zealand, their basketball team is nicknamed the "tall blacks", don't think that would fly over here <|endoftext|>  I was unaware of that. In the US the supreme court building has a basketball court on the top floor. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello. Do you watch sports much? <|endoftext|>  I do! I like basketball, though I was never very good as a kid as I'm not very tall. How about you?

 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about the Catholic Church? It scares me that they don't have a system in place for reporting misconduct <|endoftext|>  I think something needs to be done about that, immediately. Too many bishops are getting away with this. Like the one in West  Virginia.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi. Do you like to travel? What is your favorite mode of transportation? <|endoftext|>  I love air travel even though it's 10% slower than it was in the 1960s as they try to save on fuel costs now. What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  hey I'm good, can you guess how much Judge Judy makes per episode?
 <|endoftext|>  It looks like the Catholic Church is providing more ways to report misconduct, which is good. <|endoftext|>  I know, there has been several scandals I agree with the full investigation of retired Archbishop Theodore.
 <|endoftext|>  How long will Trump remain president of the United States? That's the real question!  <|endoftext|>  I don't know. did you know the top three wealthiest presidents are jfk washington and jefferson
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know 7% of people actually read the full TOS when buying products and apps online? <|endoftext|>  I'm shocked that it's that high actually haha. I know that I never read those things haha. Other shocking thing is that there is actually 3-g cell service at the top of Mount Everest, good to know that I'll be able to post on Facebook while I'm hiking haha

 <|endoftext|>  Do you keep up with any celebrities?  <|endoftext|>  Not really, most of them are complete idiots.  I do remember the SNL Celebrity Jeopardy skit.  The Burt Reynolds character was hilarious.
 <|endoftext|>  I've heard that religion and politics are some of the most uncomfortable things one can discuss with others. With that in mind, I'm all in on the Bull Moose party. Yourself? <|endoftext|>  I've actually never heard of the Bull Moose party.  As far as politics go I would say I am currently for the republican party, otherwise known as the grand old party.
 <|endoftext|>  did you know new yorks area code is 212 because it was the fastest to dial on a rotary phone? crazy huh <|endoftext|>  Sort of makes sense.  I saw a couple of 17 year olds who were given a rotary phone and 4 minutes to make a call and they could not figure it out. The cables across the ocean just lay on the floor.  I don't know how else they would manage them.
 <|endoftext|>  hello,  how are you?  did you know The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana <|endoftext|>  I'm good, thank you, no I didn't! That is quite funny.  Do you know who the last u.s. president to speak a foreign language fluently was?

 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to go to concerts?  <|endoftext|>  I do, but only small venues as I get claustrophobic... You?

 <|endoftext|>  Hey, did you know Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph? <|endoftext|>  I'd heard something like. Something about being frustrated by late fees. Serves Blockbuster right!
 <|endoftext|>  Hello <|endoftext|>  Good morning.  Do you watch the Emmy's?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there! How are you? I'm hanging out watching Netflix. Can't believe it was founded in 1997. <|endoftext|>  I'm doing good. Yeah, I can't believe it all started because Reed Jastings had a $40 late fee for a VHS

 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? do you like to travel? <|endoftext|>  Hi. I am good. How are you?  I do like to travel.  I would love to travel to Iceland even though it has no public rail service.
 <|endoftext|>  It's hard to say whether it's black and white, but I think each department has a responsibility to figure out what's best for their own officers. <|endoftext|>  I would encourage police to shoot through their windshield if it meant saving lives and stopping criminals.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you like to travel? <|endoftext|>  I used to.  Nowadays travel has gotten too cramped and unpleasant for me.  Do you like to travel?

 <|endoftext|>  What are your opinions about NBA players making a load of money to just shoot a ball? Like Allen Iverson makes $32,000,000! Insane! <|endoftext|>  Yeah I agree with you I think it's pretty ridiculous. The best paid athletes in by average annual salary per player-must be nice!

That's really cool, but in the same league they allow the New Orleans saints to make a rule that if a player enters a restaurant, and there is a cheerleader already there, that the cheerleader has to leave.  That's ridiculous!

I love the NFL because it is the highest professional level of football in the world! <|endoftext|>  Can't say I'm a huge fan.

 <|endoftext|>  Do you enjoy the NFL? <|endoftext|>  I do enjoy it a lot! In fact, I love the Patriots. Crazy to think the Patriots are equal to the Bills, at least in Super Bowl losses!

 <|endoftext|>  I don't understand why the patriots are so hated <|endoftext|>  It's because they are a dynasty and everyone gets sick of seeing the same team in the superbowl again and again.

There are communications from a youtube video from a Chinese woman addressing her husband and saying she hasn't contacted him due to relationship issues and to stop writing.   <|endoftext|>  Yeah I guess in 2017 Chen began interviewing billionaire Guo Wengui and aired his reports on Huopai's you tube channel.

 <|endoftext|>  I'm not much of a fan of Tom Brady, the quarterback for the Patriots.   <|endoftext|>  I'm not a fan either, but he has an impressive record. Do you watch football?
 <|endoftext|>  hello, nfl watcher? <|endoftext|>  yes i am.  i love football

 <|endoftext|>  Do you like football? <|endoftext|>  I do like football. Do you like it?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a Tom Brady fan?  <|endoftext|>  Hello, no I am not. I do find it oddly satisfying that his wife makes more money than he does
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, did you know the top 3 wealthiest presidents were JKF, Jefferson, and Washington. <|endoftext|>  No, that's interesting.  I thought Trump would be up there.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey what do you think about Stormy Daniels by the way? Do you think she is right or wrong <|endoftext|>  Isn't she a porn star?

Did you know Mcdonalds' added drive-thru in 1975 to accommodate soldiers who were not allowed to get out of their cars while wearing their fatigues. <|endoftext|>  I learned that a few days ago.  It is surprising how often a minor cause creates a lucrative new business.

 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, did you know it's possible to make a radio with a razorblade and pencil? <|endoftext|>  That is cool.     Electromagnetic energy waves are very interesting things.
 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever thought about drive-thrus?  I've heard that Mcdonalds invented the drive thru just to help out soldiers back in the day. <|endoftext|>  I havent given too much thought to that but it seems interesting, kind of the aggressive mode google self driving cars have.
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? <|endoftext|>  Good. Did you know there are over 1.25 billion cars in the world?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you have a favorite kind of shoe? <|endoftext|>  Not sure, I like the brand Nike and sport shoes, what about you?

 <|endoftext|>  Hello how are you doing?  Did you know Professional ballet dancers can go through 4 pairs of pointe shoes in a week. <|endoftext|>  I am well. That's amazing! Their poor feet! 5000 year old shoes perform better than modern shoes.

 <|endoftext|>  I can't believe the US federal debt is about $15 trillion dollars!   <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? yes, it is hard to believe, and it will only get worse.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello. How are you doing. <|endoftext|>  Im doing great, did you know Trump isnt the richest president in US history, that fact came as a suprise to me

 <|endoftext|>  Hi do you watch fox news? <|endoftext|>  Hi, yes, I watch Fox news and CNN just to get both sides of the story and then decide for myself, who's actually telling the truth!
 <|endoftext|>  I read an interesting article <|endoftext|>  Oh yeah, what was it about? I read some where that woodrow wilson was the only us president with a phd. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, are you a fan of the President? <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? You mean President Trump?
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning to you. Do you ever listen to the radio? I think it's so cool how it uses different properties of electromagnetic energy to transmit waves through space. <|endoftext|>  radio really is a cool medium. it is still valuable to use, though most people prefer video. it dont listen now as much as I used to.
 <|endoftext|>  hello <|endoftext|>  The shooting in Pittsburgh was a terrible thing
 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to the radio?  <|endoftext|>  No, not now. I use Apple tunes I bought for the drive into work in the morning, but yes; ealier in my life we lived on radio. Music, talk, morning drive was always an institution.I see where one of the most popular radio acts in the 1930's was a ventriloquuist. I wonder how that worked.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, do you listen to the radio much? <|endoftext|>  Sometimes, I would say Im more into podcasts, but I hear that Jupiter has some strong radio storms that can be picked up on AM radio
 <|endoftext|>  I did not know that Fox News was so popular, more than CNN and MSNBC combined. <|endoftext|>  Me too, I also did not know that Fox news threatened to sue The Simpsons. Even though it's a comedy cartoon, they took it seriously.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  Do you follow politics? <|endoftext|>  Mostly I do. Though I will admit, I get tired of all the bickering! How about you? Are you interested in congress and the President?

I am definitely interested in your thoughts about the President and where things are headed. on a lighter note, I learned something interesting today. Did you know that radio station translates solar activity into sound?... mind blown
 <|endoftext|>  hey did you know that Trump wouldn't be in the top 3 wealthiest presidents if you consider all of them? <|endoftext|>  Wow, that's interesting! I suppose that is something Sean Hannity of Fox News would know since his shows are all about the president! 
 <|endoftext|>  Hilarious that Fox News tried to sue the Simpsons for parodying it. I suppose Ailes didn't understand the Streisand Effect, perhaps due to the fact that he's an older guy and not super familiar with the internet.  <|endoftext|>  Not a huge fan of Fox News. Even more surprising that they're more watched than CNN and MSNBC combined.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you watch fox News? <|endoftext|>  I try not to, I find them a bit slanted.  
 <|endoftext|>  Hi do you watch Fox news? <|endoftext|>  Yes sometimes. Did you know they are owned by the same company that owns the IGN website?

 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, are you a big listener of the radio? <|endoftext|>  Hi, well I used to as a kid, I can't say that I listen to it anymore though, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  I did not know that Laura Ingraham was considered for white House Press Secretary.  it seems she would make more money and be better off with her talk shows. <|endoftext|>  I believe she was an early supporter of Trumpism, I do not know if she still is.
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  hey, I know a little bit, can you guess the top 3 richest presidents?
 <|endoftext|>  Have you heard about the March for Our Lives? <|endoftext|>  I have heard of it. I think it was in response to a shooting that happened in Florida correct?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow the NFL? <|endoftext|>  I usually follow during the playoffs and the Super Bowl.
 <|endoftext|>  Do follow the NFL? <|endoftext|>  I do! Do you like the patriots?

I wonder if women will play in the future. <|endoftext|>  Hi! Yes! I didn't know that. I'm a huge Giants fan but i love Gronk. I would  kill my brother if he called to complain about my job though to a radio station!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you like football? <|endoftext|>  Sometimes I watch it on TV.

 <|endoftext|>  Good evening. Do you enjoy the game of baseball?  <|endoftext|>  I sure do! I think it is funny that people in Japan are surprised that baseball is America's favorite pastime since it is so popular there.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you doing this evening? <|endoftext|>  Pretty well and you? do you watch baseball?

 <|endoftext|>  Hello. Are you a fan of That 70's Show? There is a British version, although it only lasted 10 episodes. <|endoftext|>  I love that 70s show. It must not have been very well received in the UK.

 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you know much about the president? <|endoftext|>  Well, I think i am learning more everyday. I respect the office of the presidency. I visited to White House an noticed how much larger the guest house seemed to be. I was looking from far away though.

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you think that President Trump is the richest one ever? <|endoftext|>  Trump? Who knows? Has anyone seen his tax returns?  Without that info, I would have to guess that JFK was richest. Am I right?
 <|endoftext|>  did you know that Trump wouldn't be in the top 3 of most wealthy Presidents? That is crazy haha <|endoftext|>  On an inflation adjust basis, I can believe it. 
 <|endoftext|>  do you like basketball? <|endoftext|>  I love it. Have you ever seen Space Jam?

 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, did you know the functions of the president is different for each state they are in? <|endoftext|>  I did not know that. I would think that would be more the Governor's responsibility. I do like when the President has a pet, like a dog, who are actually not colorblind.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi.  I heard an interesting fact recently.  Did you know that the three richest presidents ever were washington, jefferson, and jfk? <|endoftext|>  Hello, they must have accomplished to people's satisfactions.

 <|endoftext|>  Do you  play fantasy football? <|endoftext|>  No, but I fantasize about playing football... Does that count?  Like, I imagine myself as Kellan Moore, the only left-handed QB currently in the NFL. WHat are your fantasies?

 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about the Falcons? I think they are a good team but with tough luck <|endoftext|>  Yes I do not follow the Falcons much - I prefer college football - they have more fun like painting locker rooms pink
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Are you an NFL fan? <|endoftext|>  I'm doing good and yes, I am a fan.  In particular I am a fan of Deshaun Watson.  He's the former Clemson quarterback that is doing so well.

 <|endoftext|>  Sup playa? Have you been playing Fantasy Football at all? The Baltimore Ravens have the second highest scoring defense <|endoftext|>  Hi there... no, sorry I wasn't... what exactly is Fantasy Football ?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey good morning. Do you like the fantasy genre? It's roots are actually in oral traditions. <|endoftext|>  Its one of my favorite genres, a fictional universe with countless of options limited only to imagination. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi. Do you like football? <|endoftext|>  Yes I watch football from time to time. I think it's ok. I do think that it's a little bit boring though, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you interested in sports, especially football? <|endoftext|>  I do watch football, sometimes, especially during the Super Bowl. Did you know the highest score of a football game ever was 222-0?
 <|endoftext|>  hi <|endoftext|>  Good afternoon.  I don't know if you are interested in politics at all, but regardless of all the controversy these days, I find the facts about government pretty interesting.  Like in most places, the term president is a common title for the head of state.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, are you a gamer? I am and find it very interesting that Baker Mayfield once thought of quitting football, to become a full time gamer. How crazy is that? <|endoftext|>  I am not a gamer but I swear my youngest son could be. That is crazy!  What I think that is even crazier is that they have a fantasy draft for the national spelling bee.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello do you follow football? <|endoftext|>  I do follow football. Do you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like watching football? <|endoftext|>  I love football, but I dislike Jimmy Garoppolo and all that he stands for. He should move to Guam!

 <|endoftext|>  I am a football fan. How about yourself? <|endoftext|>  I'm a huge fan, I watch as many game as I can and play fantasy. Do you play fantasy football?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey!  Do you have an interest in football? <|endoftext|>  Not that much as the game kind of confuses me. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  hey, did you know that iowa's locker room for visiting teams is painted pink? That's pretty funny to me haha <|endoftext|>  I didnt know that but I agree it must be curious to be the visiting team, wonder if that really works or just makes the other team angry.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you remember about the confidential informant in the Trump campaign? <|endoftext|>  I had a vague recollection of that.  It was an FBI spy, right?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you play fantasy football?  <|endoftext|>  I don't but my kids do. They love it. They just hate when their team has a bye week and they can play their favorite players! It hurts when Tom Brady has a bye week. LOL. 
 <|endoftext|>  Good Morning.  Are you a football fan?  Playoff season is here. <|endoftext|>  I am a fan.  I do fantasy football.  I saw that the National spelling bee is a fantasy draft.  Crazy.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you play any fantasy sport games? <|endoftext|>  I never have but I've heard that you can even play fantasy spelling bee! So I can't promise that some day I won't try it, in one way or another! Ha
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there, I found it pretty interesting that the Presidential runner-up became the Vice President until 1805  <|endoftext|>  Hi. I thought that was awesome too. But now they have more choice in who they can work with. I thought it was awesome that Canadian law requires radio stations to play Canadian music 40 percent of the time.
 <|endoftext|>  I didn't know that JFK was one of the top three wealthiest presidents. He must have had money. <|endoftext|>  Wow!  Who were the other two?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there!  Do you follow politics? <|endoftext|>  I do somewhat, it's hard to watch a lot of the news today though it seems so negative.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I'm doing great!  How about you?  Are you interested in Representative Comstock at all in her Northern Virginia GOP primary?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  I do from time to time, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi. Are you into the fantasy football? They even have a fantasy draft for the spelling bee! <|endoftext|>  I do belong to a fantasy football league. This year I pretty much just let AI pick my team and it sure showed. I came in last place. I just havent been watching much football in the past couple of years.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I'm doing well and you?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a big fan of watching tv? <|endoftext|>  I watch stuff I download on my computer. I dont have cable anymore.
 <|endoftext|>  With out going into an hour long tirade let me simply say that where Trump is concerned, I am not a fan. <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? What bothers you the most about him?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you know much about the presidents? <|endoftext|>  Trump could possibly win a reelection, he has a lot of supporters
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  Hey, I'm great thanks! Yes I do! Did you know that according to Canadian law, all radios are required to play at least 40% Canadian music?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you believe the news media and media in general is biased? <|endoftext|>  You would hope that it is not.  If one person had a platform to deliver a biased  message, no harm.  If a person owns a lot of platforms. Thats dangerous.
 <|endoftext|>  do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I know that WIlson was the only one to have a PhD
 <|endoftext|>  Do you subscribe to a print newspaper? <|endoftext|>  I do not subscribe to a print newspaper, but if I were the person in the first article I am not sure I would receive it anyone since the kid plowed the mailbox over. 
 <|endoftext|>  hi, how are you? do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  Hi im doing good.  how are you?  Yeah I listen to it sometimes. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi - Do you like cars? <|endoftext|>  Yeah. Well I like mine at least. Lol.
 <|endoftext|>  Good afternoon. Do you like cars? I think the 1908 model T was a classic because it was the first car available to everyone! <|endoftext|>  I drive a car so I suppose I do.  More out of necessity than anything else.
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  I do. I find radio fascinating. Its crazy how long ago they figured out the technology to use radio waves to transmit information.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, Do you like movies and dramas? <|endoftext|>  Hello there, yes, I am a big movie fan not so much dancing though.  How about yourself?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there do you drive a car? I use mine almost everyday <|endoftext|>  Hello,  yes I drive a car.  
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you drive? <|endoftext|>  I do not drive. I have a phobia.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you own a car? <|endoftext|>  We do own a car, I have to drive the kids here, there and everywhere.
 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever had to call New York using a rotary phone?  <|endoftext|>  No I have actually never had to call someone in New York before. Come to think of it I have never used a rotaryphone. It's amazing to think that the inventor of the dial telephone was convinced phone operators routed his calls to rival businesses!
 <|endoftext|>  do you like cars? <|endoftext|>  Love cars. DO you know who invented the drive thru?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! <|endoftext|>  Hi there, are you a big car person?
 <|endoftext|>  Fun fact: the top 3 wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington and Jefferson. I'm skeptical, how to you compare a horse to a limo? <|endoftext|>  And they accomplished that without releasing 3 pop albums while in office like inodesias president.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that up until 1805, the runner-up to President of the US became the Veep? <|endoftext|>  Yeah,  i wish that was still a thing.  The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana
 <|endoftext|>  Good evening!  It might be fun to have a President Banana in the White House right?  That was the name of Zimbabwe's first president actually, but we can dream. <|endoftext|>  That certainly would be fun!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you?\ <|endoftext|>  Good, thanks, how are you?
 <|endoftext|>  So, do you think it that maybe it would be better if our President were just the head of state instead of also the head of government? <|endoftext|>  I actually think it is pretty good how it is now. I was able to visit Washington DC recently and it very small compared to the guest house. I enjoyed looking at it though. HA
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  I know they live in the White House!
 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to the Radio?  <|endoftext|>  Yes, mostly on my commute to and from work every day.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know any interesting facts about the presidents? <|endoftext|>  Good morning.  I might know a couple.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a football fan? Do you watch the NFL? <|endoftext|>  I'm a fan but don't get to watch much. I here there are no written rules concerning female players.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to the radio?  <|endoftext|>  I listen to spotify, does that count? Do you listen to the radio?
 <|endoftext|>  do you know much about the president? <|endoftext|>  I know that WIlson was the only one to have a PhD
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  Sometimes, mostly when I am in my car. And you ?
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? <|endoftext|>   I'm good thanks. I like learning facts about the government. Did you know the White House has twin buildings in Ireland and France?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, what do you think about that memo to New York Times publisher <|endoftext|>  Sounds like he was going to wasting his time trying to take down Trump's fake news slogan. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello!  Are you a fan of the NFL? <|endoftext|>  Yes I am. Are you.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! <|endoftext|>  Hello. The president has been tweeting all morning again today.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know anything about the background of Trump's Director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow? <|endoftext|>  I do not personally know anything about Trump or his people, but I do know that Woodrow Wilson is the only president with a phd.
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? the sun is shining where I am. how about you? <|endoftext|>  I'm doing well! Yes same here in Colorado! I wonder what it would be like if our sunset was blue like Mars?
 <|endoftext|>  did you know the white house has the same buildings in both france and ireland <|endoftext|>  I have not heard that. It's amazing that the White House has been in residence since 1800
 <|endoftext|>  How are you? Did you know that a president is a title given to leaders of republican state? <|endoftext|>  i had no clue!The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana
 <|endoftext|>  Hi.  Did you know the US President's guest house is larger that the White House? <|endoftext|>  I think I did hear that somewhere. I bet they use it a lot as well.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello <|endoftext|>  Hi.  What do you think about Mr. Corallo's (Trump administration) claim?
 <|endoftext|>  Good afternoon there partner. Have you ever seen the White House? I really want to go to Washington DC to check it out one day. <|endoftext|>  I have not but apparently you don't just have to go to Washington to see it. they have twin building,  ones in France and Ireland.  
 <|endoftext|>  do you like the NFL? <|endoftext|>  i sure do. did you know women can play too?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey did you hear how Trump called illegal immigrants animals recently <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Did he? I'm not surprised. He shoots off his mouth a lot. He probably call them something different next time.
 <|endoftext|>  hi <|endoftext|>  Hello, did you ever hear much about Spygate in the news? I didn't hear any of this shocking information.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  Common title for head of state, but can mean different things depending the type of government  What do yo have in mind?
 <|endoftext|>  do you know much about the white house? <|endoftext|>  I know that Carter kept the temperature really low there during winter
 <|endoftext|>  The White House is a place with a lot of history, its located in Washington D.C. <|endoftext|>  it still uses floppy disks in part for storing files
 <|endoftext|>  Hi do you know many presidential facts? <|endoftext|>  I love president facts! Do you know the three wealthiest presidents? 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Oh, I'm great. Just kicking back and listening to the radio. Do you radios?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know anything about Zimbabwe? <|endoftext|>  not really, you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello.  Apparently, Kennedy, Washington and Jefferson were the top three wealthiest presidents. <|endoftext|>  Hello,  Trump is definitely number one on the wealthiest presidents list!  Thats interesting though!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you like radio programs? <|endoftext|>  I don't listen to them much, but I like listening to music on the radio. What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  I'm doing great thanks how are you? The radio is cool. Especially how it uses electromagnetic energy to transmit waves through space and produce sound.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you comfortable talking about the government? <|endoftext|>  Sure, I think trump should be President Banana, instead of the President of Zimbabwe.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, I hope you are doing well today.  Did you know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called? <|endoftext|>  The first president of Zimbabwe was know as President Banana, I wonder if he looked like one or just liked bananas a lot
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Hello! Pretty good. Do you like the radio?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you still listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  I sure do! I've even herd that there are radio storms so strong on Jupiter they can be heard on an AM radio.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that Trump is not among the 3 most wealthiest potus'? <|endoftext|>  I believe I did hear that. Even so, I'd like to have some of his money. I think it's admirable that he refuses to accept a salary.
 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever seen Hope Hicks? I think she's very attractive. <|endoftext|>  No, I haven't, is she an actress or a performer or something?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like Trump as president? <|endoftext|>  Sure, I've also met Larry Kudlow. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there partner. Isn't it crazy that we choose one leader to make decisions for 350 million people in our country! <|endoftext|>  Yeah that is interesting. Luckily we don't automatically let the runner up in a presidential election become vice president anymore. That would be...interesting!
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning, do you follow politics? <|endoftext|>  A bit
 <|endoftext|>  Hi. Do you like to listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  Sometimes. I used to listen to the radio a lot as a kid. Didn't have a TV, so not much choice there.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! I was just reading about how John Chapman who passed rescuing a navy seal will recieve the medal of honor, sad story.  <|endoftext|>  Hello there, it sounds like he was a brave man who sacrificed himself for the good of others. 
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, did you know the 3 wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson <|endoftext|>  Hello! I didn't know that, isn't it surprising that Donald Trump isn't one of the three wealthiest!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi. Did you know that the White House has twin buildings in Ireland and France? <|endoftext|>  The White House does? I did not know that! So ol' 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue isn't as unique as I thought it was! There is also a replica in Atlanta which was built as a private home.
 <|endoftext|>  I never knew that ringo starr narrated some episodes of thomas the thank engine. <|endoftext|>  Yes.     Funny that he was the more mild Narrator, compared to George Carlin and Alec Baldwin
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how's it going? Did you hear about the police arresting the man who made threatening tweets against the football coach Jeff Brohm? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I did.  If the coach wanted to stay with Boilermakers,  it was not  his business. I wonder how the police found this guy.  Do you know who this guy is?
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you watch football? <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you mean american football or british football? Or Australian football? 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? Do you follow sports at all? <|endoftext|>  I don't follow sports that much. I did watch the Superbowl this year, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, do you watch much television? <|endoftext|>  Not a whole lot, but I have recently watched a program about Judge Kavanaugh. Do you watch much television?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, are you a big tv fan?  If so, what is your favorite show? <|endoftext|>  I do like some tv, I like the simpsons, seinfeld, and south park, I guess they all begin with S's somehow haha, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey! Seen any good TV shows lately? <|endoftext|>  the expance is great i think.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you this morning? <|endoftext|>  Great.  I think the rhetoric of our era is very biased and unfair to Trump.  I don't think the press and celebrities should continue to complain about the election.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you watch much television? <|endoftext|>  Yeah, I watch some shows from time to time, you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, do you watch much television? <|endoftext|>  I use too. I stream a lot more now due to advertisements. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  hey did you know that Trump wouldn't qualify as one of the top 3 most wealthy presidents in US history? <|endoftext|>  Interesting, I suppose on an inflation adjusted basis that may be right. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there, did you know there is a 3g internet tower at the top of Everest? <|endoftext|>  wow I didn't know that, good thing people can take selfies at the top! have you ever used a hamburger button online?
 <|endoftext|>  I suppose you know that there are 32 teams in the NFL? <|endoftext|>  I knew there were a lot, but I don't think I knew the exact number. That makes sense though with how it's separated between the NFC and AFC
 <|endoftext|>  did you know that there's a version of soccer where three teams face each other, at the same time? it's pretty cool <|endoftext|>  Wild game. I would love to see that and listen to the announcers trying to keep track of everything. Do they play with more than one ball?
 <|endoftext|>  I really hope Lamar Jackson does well <|endoftext|>  He did pretty well in college. Winning the heisman is a big accomplishment 
 <|endoftext|>  I am watching the news on television right now - do you remember when all of the tvs were black and white? <|endoftext|>  I don't remember that though I do remember having one black and white tv. Interesting that before WWII the TV was not commonplace in homes.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you more a fan of gridiron football or soccer? <|endoftext|>  I enjoyed both. Probably soccer more. What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you doing this fine evening? <|endoftext|>  Hi hows it going? I am good.  do you watch television?
 <|endoftext|>  I couldn't live with out the internet.  Thank goodness it's even accessible from Mt. Everest, although the 3 g speed would annoy me.   <|endoftext|>  For sure, I wouldnt be able to climb Mt everest without my phone! I love me some television though
 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  i used to listen to the radio. not so much now. you?
 <|endoftext|>  Would you be much of a sports fan? <|endoftext|>  I enjoy watching football. My favorite position is the quarterback because they are considered the leader of the offensive team.
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  I do like to listen to it on the way to work. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  How are you today? <|endoftext|>  Great! I was just doing a little shopping online. Browsing the Amazon internet jungle... You?
 <|endoftext|>  Would you like to travel up the Amazon River? <|endoftext|>  I think that would be wonderful. I would love to see the indigenous people and also all the animals and plants.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how do you feel about Amazon?  Personally I couldnt live without them. <|endoftext|>  Hello, I love Amazon. I'm a prime member. What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning, have you ever picked up any of the radio storms from Jupiter? They can be found sometimes on an AM station. <|endoftext|>  I have not actually. I do know that there is a way to make a radio using a razorblade and a pencil as a diode.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there!  Do you still listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  In the car, the radio is on.  I have one here in the office.  I might turn it on. It is creepy thinking about radio waves and oscillating fields.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to the radio still? <|endoftext|>  Yes, on the way to work. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like to laugh? <|endoftext|>  Yes. Who doesn't like to laugh? Maybe nuns?
 <|endoftext|>  What kind of comedy do you like ? I like satire.  <|endoftext|>  I really like dark humor and ironic comedy
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! Are you a NFL fan? <|endoftext|>  Yes I am.  Did you know that they don't have any rules against women playing?
 <|endoftext|>  Im tired of the mass shootings that occur in the US, it shreds families into pieces and they cause a lot of suffering <|endoftext|>  I hear you. I don't know what can be done. Either the guns laws have to be changed, or police need to be posted in more places. The political situation is untenable.
 <|endoftext|>  hey there my friend do you watch Fox news at all? <|endoftext|>  Not a whole lot. I hear they wanted to create a channel that only played the simpsons.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like the Simpsons? <|endoftext|>  I do like the Simpsons.
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? what do you think of fox news? <|endoftext|>  I think its a great channel, I get my news from that source, what are your thoughts?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, I figured JFK was one of the wealthiest presidents in american history <|endoftext|>  I am not at all surprised to hear that. I feel like they are the closest thing the U.S. has had to royalty. 
 <|endoftext|>  Fox News is a great channel do you watch it? <|endoftext|>  I do watch it every now and then!  How about you!  Know anything interesting about it?
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? do you use amazon? <|endoftext|>  I love shopping at amazon, its a great site what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you a football fan? I love the NFL, even if there's only 11 minutes of live gameplay each game. Ha! <|endoftext|>  Yeah, I am! Yu'd think there would be live gameplay considering how popular it is.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you watch the NFL? <|endoftext|>  I do a lot actually. Did you know women can play too?
 <|endoftext|>  HI how are you? <|endoftext|>  I'm doing well. Are you a fan of Brett Farve? 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there do you watch any football? I wish I could have seen the highest scoring football game ever <|endoftext|>  hello, me too. is that the 222-0 one?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello!  Do you watch Netflix or Youtube.  I watch both.  It is no wonder that together they make up half of peak internet traffic in North America.   <|endoftext|>  Hi there, yes I love Netflix. DO you know how it came about, the company?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi turker, are you a football fan, if you are what is your favorite team? <|endoftext|>  I am not a huge fan of football,  but I like the 49ers.  how about u?
 <|endoftext|>  Greetings! Are you a Netflix user by any chance? I just learned that Netflix accounts for a third of all internet bandwidth between 9 p.m. and midnight. That's a lot of people streaming movies and shows! <|endoftext|>  Ain't much on TV these days. Folks want quality entertainment. Youtube also sucks up tons of bandwidth.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you like basketball? NBA fan? <|endoftext|>  Yea, out of the 30 NBA teams the Knicks are my favorite
 <|endoftext|>  Good Morning! Do you like to watch sports? <|endoftext|>  I do like to watch. I really like basketball. What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you like Basketball? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I am a huge fan as a matter of fact! But knowing the highest paid employee in 39 states are either college football or basketball coaches is shocking. Are you a basketball fan as well?
 <|endoftext|>  hi <|endoftext|>  Hey man, what's up?
 <|endoftext|>  Air Force One is an amazing plane - have you ever seen it? <|endoftext|>  I have, Ive seen it on picture and on some movies, it does look like a great plane, 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! Do you like to travel? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do when i have the time and the money which is not often these days. You?
 <|endoftext|>  Good Morning! Do you like cars?  <|endoftext|>  Yes. I like cars. Cars is a motor vehicle used for transportation in roads and carry people safely.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you interested in travel, cars, or the President? <|endoftext|>  I do. Did you know the three wealthiest presidents in US history were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. I find it surprising since it's not anyone recent.
 <|endoftext|>  I travel when I get the chance. Do you like to travel? <|endoftext|>  Yes I like to travel, I've been many places.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Do you like sports? I really like football and to be honest, I didn't really enjoy the super bowl game, but I do like the quarterback, Tom Brady. <|endoftext|>  I like some sports. I did watch the Super Bowl and it was crazy boring. I'm not a Brady fan but I respect his talent. Are you familiar with Alex Smith?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you like football. I love it my favorite team is the Steelers. <|endoftext|>  Cool, I do too.  Don't hate me, but my favorite team is the Patriots!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi. I was wondering if you like Football at all. <|endoftext|>  I do, what about you? I wonder how Saquon Barkley would have done with the Browns
 <|endoftext|>  Good Evening!  Do you like soccer? <|endoftext|>  I really don't get into it.  I respect the sport.  I do know that the U.S. got 3rd place in the st FIFA World Cup in 1930.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you remember where the 2018 Olympics took place? <|endoftext|>  I do, it was held in PyeongChang.  I believe that is in China.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you watch the winter Olympics <|endoftext|>  Some of it. Did you know that there are no economic gains for countries that have hosted the Olympics or World Cup?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like watching sports? <|endoftext|>  don't have a lot of time to do that... sometimes...
 <|endoftext|>  hey my friend did you know that the guest house is actually bigger than the entire white house? <|endoftext|>  I did.  that is pretty amazing.  I recently learned that the president of indonesia released  pop albums!
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  hi I'm good, did you know that trump is not one of the top 3 wealthiest presidents? I would have thought he was
 <|endoftext|>  There seems to be a lot of chatter about Trump being hostile to black female journalists huh? <|endoftext|>  I don't really know a lot about it.  what exactly has happened
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  I am fine, currently reading about interesting facts about all presidents around the world. Do you know any?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Are you a sports fan? Football or baseball? <|endoftext|>  Both.  I like basketball too.  One of the 30 NBA teams is in Canada, so the players have to pay higher taxes.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you think great broadcasters are important to sports games? <|endoftext|>  I don't know. I guess I don't really care because I don't watch sports haha but I know that a lot of people do think that they are very important. And they can pick them out of a crowd which I can't haha what do you think?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there, are you a fan of the NBA? <|endoftext|>  I watch every now and then. I enjoy college BBall more. Less predictable. It's hard to believe that the NBA was founded in 1946.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi Do you like basketball? <|endoftext|>  I love basketball. My favorite player all time is Cheryl miller.
 <|endoftext|>  A fan of baseball? If you're Japanese there's a good chance you're a huge fan. <|endoftext|>  How come there's an association with Japanese liking baseball? I prefer other sports like football and basketball. Though even from being in Texas, I have never heard of the high school stadium that costs $60 million to build and can seat 18K people! 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi! Do you like football? <|endoftext|>  Yes, although the word can mean any different games.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know the visiting locker room at University of Iowa is painted pink? <|endoftext|>  woah! why do you thnk that is?
 <|endoftext|>  There never seems to be ANYTHING positive about Trump from the MSM.  CBS is now saying that Trump has something against babies.  This isn't journalism, it's amateur hour... <|endoftext|>  I agree with you on that.  They hate him and it shows every time they open their mouth.  It's actually kind of funny to watch them.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, did you know that JFK, Wasington, and Jefferson where the the richest Presidents in American history? <|endoftext|>  I did not. I thought our current one was the richest.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know the president of Indonesia has released 3 pop albums <|endoftext|>  Did you know that the president of zimbabwe was called president banana?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you have any thoughts on the manner in which Trump puts down those who do not agree with him? <|endoftext|>  What I can tell also, meaning grow up!  He seems to use it alot in this article. I wonder if president Banana feels the same way?lol
 <|endoftext|>  Its kind of crazy to think about how cars use to have wooden trunks. Now we know why their called "trunks." <|endoftext|>  I didn't know that! It's surprising to see how long we've come since wooden trunks! I mean cars have rear reversing cameras, air conditioning, navigation systems, and in-car entertainment! I actually can't believe people would equip their cars with flame throwers!
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? would you kidnap a goat? <|endoftext|>  No, I dont think so lol, maybe if it was a famous goat like Bill the Goat
 <|endoftext|>  Good evening there. Do you like dogs? I love them because they're truly man's best friend. <|endoftext|>  That's nice. I'm more interested in the practical contributions they can make, like hunting and protection.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of football?  <|endoftext|>  I love football, both NFL and College! You?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, Do you watch much TV these days? <|endoftext|>  Occasionally although I mostly stick with Netflix for addle tv shows. What about you?

 <|endoftext|>  Do you attend many musical concerts? <|endoftext|>  I have been to many concerts how about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to the radio? I used to but now not so much. <|endoftext|>  When i kid i listened to baseball games and music.  These days i never do.  Speaking of radios, did you that Jupiter has radio storms so strong they can be picked up by AM radio?
 <|endoftext|>  DO you like to watch television ? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I do like to watch TV though I mostly watch Netflix. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Good morning! Did you know that in South Africa, it is legal to equip your car with flame-throwers to prevent carjacking?
 <|endoftext|>  I read about a crazy woman who killed someone because the other driver was too slow. <|endoftext|>  Is that the lady who got road rage simply because she wanted to make her car payment?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there. I heard that Laura Ingraham is being sued. Did you hear that yet? <|endoftext|>  Yeah, I heard that Laura was very demanding and when her assistant got pregnant she was fired.
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, do you know 1886 is considered the birth year of the car? <|endoftext|>  Oh wow, I didn't know that. I was recently reading a story about a horrific car accident car, Yikes
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! Have you ever been to the white house? <|endoftext|>  I have not. What about yourself?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  hey I know a little bit about fdr, I guess he was the last US president to speak a foreign language fluently

It's like having a friend you can see whenever you want, especially in the age of streaming. You can watch anything from South Park to the news.
 <|endoftext|>  good morning to you! <|endoftext|>  Donald Trump commuted Alice Johnson's sentence after discussion with Kim Kardashian West.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you watch tv frequently? <|endoftext|>  I do a little bit. How about you? I used to love that 70 show. Its one of my all time favorites.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello.  I've been research politics of late. Did you know that the office of president has different powers in different countries? <|endoftext|>  I did not know that, that's really interesting. 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know who Steve Bannon is? <|endoftext|>  I think so. He worked for the Trump campaign didn't he? What do you know about him?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know that Trump is not the wealthiest president? <|endoftext|>  Really?Who is?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there ! Looking forward to chat with You ! <|endoftext|>  Same; Do you follow the NFL?
 <|endoftext|>  A quarterback (commonly abbreviated "QB") is a position in American and Canadian football.  <|endoftext|>  I am a huge Brady fan, he is the best QB of all time!
 <|endoftext|>  Are you familiar with the NFL? <|endoftext|>  Only a little. Do you follow it?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you like NFL football? <|endoftext|>  Yes I do! I wish the season was shorter though 17 week regular season drags on!
 <|endoftext|>  Hello. Did you know the NFL doesn't have a rule against women players? <|endoftext|>  That's interesting. They aren't totally about equal rights, though. For example, New Orleans Saints cheerleaders aren't allowed to eat at the same restaurants as players
 <|endoftext|>  Hey, good to have you on with me today! Are you a big football fan?  <|endoftext|>  As a matter of fact I am, and play fantasy and watch at least a couple games per weekend. You?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there.  Do you like dancing? <|endoftext|>  To watch or to actually dance because it's been a while?
 <|endoftext|>  How are you? Do you watch the nfl? The Redskins recently signed Alex Smith until the 2022 season as their quarterback <|endoftext|>  hi, do you watch football?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  Do you follow football? <|endoftext|>  Hello,  not really but I do watch it sometimes.  How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there do you ever watch the NFL on TV? I know that I watch the Super Bowl <|endoftext|>  I missed the Superbowl this year, but judging from the score didn't seem to be an outstandingly played game.  But still must be an improvement over the first playoffs in 1932.
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think of Tim Tebow? Mike Francesca said playing him is a clown move. <|endoftext|>  I think he might surprise some people, he might not have a good track record lately but who knows, what are your thoughts on the matter?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of the Redskins? <|endoftext|>  Yes, I am.  What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like baseball, maybe the Mets? <|endoftext|>  Yeah I do. Not so much the Mets but I think it's funny Tebow almost played on opening day for them. 
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow college football? <|endoftext|>  i dont really follow college football. You?
 <|endoftext|>  do you like basketball? <|endoftext|>  do you like basketball?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you use facebook? <|endoftext|>  I do. Though I should use less of it, it's gotten very political.
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of facebook? <|endoftext|>  I use it to keep in touch with people so I guess I'm a fan in that respect. Why would BK give free stuff to people that unfriend others?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi Are you a Facebook fan? <|endoftext|>  Not really.  I use it occasionally, but I do not like their privacy issues and the role it plays in the whole fake news fiasco
 <|endoftext|>  hi, how are you? do you like football? <|endoftext|>  Yea I watch football all the time, it's a shame Alex Smith got injured but he can always fall back on something else considering he started his master's degree before being drafted
 <|endoftext|>  Such a shame to hear of the college players suicide. <|endoftext|>  Very sad!!! Way too young!
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of football? <|endoftext|>  I am - I wanted to lead the team and be a quarterback when I was growing up but I was never that good
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? do you like the radio? <|endoftext|>  Yea, it's pretty cool how sound is produce through electromagnetic energy waves through space
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know a Bertram Snyder from Maryland? <|endoftext|>  no, but it looks like he was an internist
 <|endoftext|>  Do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  Hello,  yes I like the radio when I can listen to it.  I use pandora or audio books a lot though lol 
 <|endoftext|>  Hello there.  Do you want to talk about the government? <|endoftext|>  Good morning! I think I could talk about the Government and politics all day long!
 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you follow politics much? <|endoftext|>  I didn't used to, but in the last three years I've gotten very interested in it. What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Good morning and thank you for chatting with me today! Do you like to listen to the radio. I find it interesting how radio's work in general. <|endoftext|>  Yea I enjoy the radio from time to time, especially radio dramas
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, are you interested in the President, Radio, or Government? <|endoftext|>  I would say I am more interested in government.  Systems or groups of people organized in a community do something to me.
 <|endoftext|>  It always saddens me to see people mistreat those who survived something as horrific as the Holocaust <|endoftext|>  It's definitely sad. People and governments can often leave others without the best support.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow politics, I think the president has a really important job. <|endoftext|>  yes I agree, and I do follow it a bit, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi!  Do you know much about presidential history? <|endoftext|>  hi how are you? i dont know much about presidential history. please enlighten me.
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you know much about the government? <|endoftext|>  Hi! I know an average amount about the government, but recently learned that the government is under intense pressure to come clean about the mistreatment of people that were invited to settle after World War II when there were labor shortages, what started those pressures anyway?
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think about the new royal couple Prince Harry and Meghan Markle? <|endoftext|>  I think its sort of interesting seeing that she is American and an actress. It s pretty cool.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, what is your opinion about the government? <|endoftext|>  Hello,  I guess it depends on what aspect of the government you are referring to.  I read recently that Nevada is mostly owned by the government. 
 <|endoftext|>  How's it going, did you know in parliamentary republics the role of president is largely ceremonial? <|endoftext|>  It's going good.  I didn't know that.  I know that in authoritarian regimes, dictaror or leader of a one party state may also be callled a president.
 <|endoftext|>  How do you think our president is doing? <|endoftext|>  If you look at the stats and avoid the so-called news, very well...
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of our president? <|endoftext|>  I am a fan of America and want our presidents to do well. Are you a fan of our president?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello - do you follow government? <|endoftext|>  I like to stay involved I am afraid ot those deaths over in Maryland and North Virignia

 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you? <|endoftext|>  Good. How are you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello.  Could you imagine if our president had biker group that was almost a military arm and really supported him?  That is what the Night Wolves are in Russia as they are pro-Putin and Kremlin. <|endoftext|>  That's not too surprising that Putin uses the Night Wolves as proxy enforcers, it's been happening throughout history
 <|endoftext|>  hi, what do you know about the government? <|endoftext|>  Hello! I think government is interesting, they can have too much power though. Did you know 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US government?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know much about climate change?  <|endoftext|>  I know a little about climate change.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, Do you listen to the radio much? <|endoftext|>  Good Afternoon!  I listen to a lot of talk radio (sports/politics) while I'm at work - passes the time and keeps me informed.  You?
 <|endoftext|>  I've never heard of the Windrush generation.  But hey, at least we aren't the only country that has immigration problems <|endoftext|>  Yeah of course, there is so much movement around the world in terms of immigration. Do you know anything about wikileaks?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you listen to the radio much? <|endoftext|>  Not really. When I was younger I did. You?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you follow what is happening in Colombia ? <|endoftext|>  I have a little bit.  The problem in South America is that all these socialist countries are realizing too late that socialism is a terrible way to govern!
 <|endoftext|>  hey did you know the guest house is bigger than the white house itself <|endoftext|>  Yes, I did. I am not surprised. I did not know there is only one president with a phd.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy Wikileaks? I guess that didn't work out so well. <|endoftext|>  Wow, didn't know that. Talk about spoiler alert. I heard a guy in France illegally sold the Eiffel Tower not just once, but twice.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello! Are you interested in the radio? <|endoftext|>  I am! I think the radio is awesome! How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi do you listen to the radio much? <|endoftext|>  Hello, yes I do actually. Did you know Bill Murray voice the human torch in the fantastic four radio show?
 <|endoftext|>  Have you ever been to Slovakia? <|endoftext|>  Hello - I have not. Have you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, How are you? Do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  Hello yes i sometimes listen to it,  do you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know many facts about the government? <|endoftext|>  Some here and there.  Like wikileaks published the governments plans to shut them down.  lol
 <|endoftext|>  hey can you guess who the top 3 wealthiest presidents are? <|endoftext|>  Hm. I'd guess JFK, Washington and Trump?
 <|endoftext|>  What do you think of the Government? there sure is a lot of speculation these days <|endoftext|>  Yeah a little too much actually. Not sure what goes on behind those curtains, I guess that is why wikileaks came about
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there partner. Do you like learning about the government? I think it's so fascinating to learn how various policies are enforced. <|endoftext|>  I do like learning about the government.
 <|endoftext|>  Do you still get a chance to listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  Hello there, I do, I found a really good local station that I like, how about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Are you comfortable talking about the government? <|endoftext|>  Sure, I'm up for talking about anything. What do you think of our president and our govt?
 <|endoftext|>  hey there, do you listen to ej radio? <|endoftext|>  No, I never heard of it. Maybe someone is trying to censor it, like the Chineese government censored the word censorship.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, did you know that 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the Government?  If they were treated like US citizens, they would be forced to sell it to pay for their massive debts. <|endoftext|>  Yes, the government does own 86% of Nevada.  Not only that, but did you hear that in 2006, the US passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva Convention?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how are you, what do you think about Trump? <|endoftext|>  I have mixed feelings, I think he can do better in some aspects, how about you?
 <|endoftext|>  I am glad that the Government is back for the next three weeks. <|endoftext|>  Me too, its a relief, hope things can settle now, did you hear the news about Alan Diaz?
 <|endoftext|>  hey there what do you think of our government and constitution <|endoftext|>  I think that like everything, there is good and bad to it.  The bad for example, I find it odd that the US government owns 86% of Nevada.  
 <|endoftext|>  Hello do you follow politics at all? <|endoftext|>  A little, what would you like to start with?
 <|endoftext|>  hi did you know the president guest house is bigger than the white house? <|endoftext|>  No that's really wild. I wonder why that is? Did you know that the president of Zimbabwe is named President banana haha
 <|endoftext|>  How are you today? <|endoftext|>  I am good but very frustrated at Jeff Sessions defending the child separation at the border.
 <|endoftext|>  Did you pay much attention to all the news about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle? <|endoftext|>  Not much, I cut off my tv last year but I see them on website headlines from time to time.
 <|endoftext|>  hey did you know the university of iowa painted the rival team's locker room pink? haha <|endoftext|>  I guess it's meant to psych out the opposition. How many home games have they won though? Talent wins.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you have a favorite football quarterback? <|endoftext|>  yes my favorite football qb is Aaron Rodgers.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi do you like to dance? Even babies spontaneously dance when music is played for them. <|endoftext|>  Yes! I am not a big dancer. I think that as we age, we lose a lot of our childlike joy in things.
 <|endoftext|>  Radford hit a crazy final shot to get into the NCAA tournament <|endoftext|>  agree, do you watch NCAA men's basketball tournament?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, I am a huge football fan. We love the Packers. How about you? <|endoftext|>  Hello, I watch some football, im not a huge fan.  I like the niners.  Did you know that in the 60's top bowlers made almost twice as much as football players?
 <|endoftext|>  When I think of football, I think of American gridiron football.  What do you think of? <|endoftext|>  I think its a great sport, I like it and find it really engaging, do you have like a favorite team?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi do you watch the NFL? <|endoftext|>  I sure do . DO you have a favorite position in the game?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello.  Do you like football? Are ready for the super bowl?  I hope we have a good game like the football game that occurred in 1916 when the score was 222-0.  Georgia tech vs. Cumberland.    <|endoftext|>  I am ready and really exited, my team is playing so I am really looking forward to it, and that would be really unusual
 <|endoftext|>  hi how are you doing today? do you like sports? <|endoftext|>  I like sports, I like all forms of football, even Canadian football. 
 <|endoftext|>  Did you hear about the Oklahoma quarterback and the Heisman Trophy he won? <|endoftext|>  Yes.  It was Kyler Murray from Oklahoma?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi how are you today? <|endoftext|>  I guess the family has been a sporting family, and not just in Football
 <|endoftext|>  hey there can you guess the 3 richest presidents in history? <|endoftext|>  I can they are jfk, washington, and jefferson. Did you know that until 1805 in the U.S. the runner up in a presidential election became the vice president.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey how's it going? What are your thoughts on the Trump administration so far? He definitely may go down as one of the wealthiest. The top 3 wealthiest are JFK, Washington, and Jefferson. <|endoftext|>  It is hard for me to imagine any president to be richer than Trump, but I guess adjusted for inflation, Washington and Jefferson are right up there
 <|endoftext|>  Are you a fan of Trump? <|endoftext|>  Hi! I certainly can't believe he isn't one of the three wealthiest presidents of all time as that was Jefferson, Washington and JFK. What about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you know much about the president or have any interesting facts? <|endoftext|>  I know the top three wealthiest presidents were Washington, Jefferson and JFK. 
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  No not really, I dont follow politics much, do you have any cool facts you would like to share with me?
 <|endoftext|>  Did you know that John F. Kennedy was the wealthiest president? <|endoftext|>  Yeah along with Jefferson and Washington, well taking into account inflation
 <|endoftext|>  Do you like the brand Nike? <|endoftext|>  I do. There was a big stand against them with the football player Colin Kaepernick. Do you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hi, how are you doing? Do you like to watch football on the TV? <|endoftext|>  Of course I do, yeah, what about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Do you own a car? <|endoftext|>  Yup I own a car and I love it. Helps me get from point a to point B. Hard to believe cars didn't always exist.
 <|endoftext|>  Hello, do you own a car? <|endoftext|>  I've had one for a couple years.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi there!  Do you use the internet a lot? <|endoftext|>  Haha-only just about all day every day.

 <|endoftext|>  Good morning! Do you follow the news? <|endoftext|>  I try to follow as much as I can, sometimes it's way too depressing. How about you?
 <|endoftext|>  Hello <|endoftext|>  It is so funny to know that  first president of zimbabwe was called president banana
 <|endoftext|>  Earth is the third from the sun in the solar system. Earth perform two activity rotation on its own axis and revolution around the sun. <|endoftext|>  Earth is very interesting. Were you also aware that 71% of the surface is water?
 <|endoftext|>  Hey there! Do you know who Kim Jong Un is? <|endoftext|>  I do, he and Trump have been all over the news because of their meeting.
 <|endoftext|>  Hi how are you doing?  This is a super funny fact: The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana <|endoftext|>  That is funny. Isn't it amazing how people rate President Trump? One man characterizes it as short term pain for long term gain with the tariffs.
 <|endoftext|>  Hey did you hear about President Trump's recent rally in Wilkes Barre Pennsylvania <|endoftext|>  I did not, I'm surprised people are liking his Twitter, it's just full of hate and lies.

 <|endoftext|>  How are you today? Do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  I do! Do you?
 <|endoftext|>  hi, do you listen to the radio? <|endoftext|>  I prefer to listen to music online. speaking of which, there is a website where you can listen to thousands of episodes of classic radio dramas for free.
 <|endoftext|>  do you know much about presidents? <|endoftext|>  I know some stuff. Do you know who the wealthiest three in the US are?
 <|endoftext|>  Before Trump, had you ever heard of Breitbart News? <|endoftext|>  No, I hadn't, I'm guessing you hadn't either?  It sounds like a news site devoted to politics?

 <|endoftext|>  Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques – including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".
This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals. <|endoftext|>  Dublin (; Irish: Baile Átha Cliath, pronounced [ˈbˠalʲə aːhə ˈclʲiə] or [ˌbʲlʲaː ˈclʲiə]) is the capital and largest city of Ireland. On a bay at the mouth of the River Liffey, it is in the province of Leinster, bordered on the south by the Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains range. At the 2016 census it had a population of 1,173,179, while the preliminary results of the 2022 census recorded that County Dublin as a whole had a population of 1,450,701, and that the population of the Greater Dublin Area was over 2 million, or roughly 40% of the Republic of Ireland's total population.A settlement was established in the area by the Gaels during or before the 7th century, followed by the Vikings. As the Kingdom of Dublin grew, it became Ireland's principal settlement by the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest in the British Empire and sixth largest in Western Europe after the Acts of Union in 1800. Following independence in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, renamed Ireland in 1937.
Dublin is a centre for education, arts and culture, administration and industry. As of 2018, the city was listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) as a global city, with a ranking of "Alpha minus", which places it as one of the top thirty cities in the world. <|endoftext|>  The United Arab Emirates (UAE; Arabic: اَلْإِمَارَات الْعَرَبِيَة الْمُتَحِدَة al-ʾImārāt al-ʿArabīyah al-Muttaḥidah), or simply the Emirates (Arabic: الِْإمَارَات al-ʾImārāt), is a country in Western Asia (The Middle East). It is located at the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula and shares borders with Oman and Saudi Arabia, while having maritime borders in the Persian Gulf with Qatar and Iran. Abu Dhabi is the nation's capital, while Dubai, the most populous city, is an international hub.
The United Arab Emirates is an elective monarchy formed from a federation of seven emirates, consisting of Abu Dhabi (the capital), Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. Each emirate is governed by an emir and together the emirs form the Federal Supreme Council. The members of the Federal Supreme Council elect a president and vice president from among their members. In practice, the emir of Abu Dhabi serves as president while the ruler of Dubai is vice president and also prime minister. In 2013, the country had a population of 9.2 million, of which 1.4 million were Emirati citizens and 7.8 million were expatriates. As of 2020, the United Arab Emirates has an estimated population of roughly 9.9 million.The area which is today the United Arab Emirates has been inhabited for over 125,000 years. It has been the crossroads of trading for many civilizations, including Mesopotamia, Persia, and India.Islam is the official religion and Arabic  the official language. The United Arab Emirates' oil and natural gas reserves are the world's sixth and seventh-largest, respectively. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the country's first president, oversaw the development of the Emirates by investing oil revenues into healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The United Arab Emirates has the most diversified economy among the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. In the 21st century, the country has become less reliant on oil and gas and is economically focusing on tourism and business. The government does not levy income tax, although there is a corporate tax in place and a 5% value-added tax was established in 2018.Human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, Freedom House and Human Rights Watch, regard UAE as generally substandard on human rights, with citizens criticising the regime imprisoned and tortured, families harassed by the state security apparatus, and cases of forced disappearances. Individual rights such as the freedoms of assembly, association, the press, expression, and religion are also severely repressed.The UAE is considered a middle power. It is a member of the United Nations, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OPEC, Non-Aligned Movement, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). <|endoftext|>  Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is home to many extremely tall modern high-rises, 108 of which stand taller than 180 metres (591 ft). The tallest building in Dubai is the Burj Khalifa, which rises 828 metres (2,717 ft) and contains 163 floors. The tower has stood as both the tallest building in the world and the tallest man-made structure of any kind in the world since its completion in January 2010. The second-tallest building in Dubai is the 425-metre (1,394 ft) Marina 101, which also stands as the world's fourth tallest residential skyscraper. The skyscrapers of Dubai are, for the most part, clustered in three different locations. The land along E 11 Road was the first to develop, followed by the Dubai Marina neighborhood and the Business Bay district.
Overall, Dubai has 18 completed and topped-out buildings that rise at least 300 metres (984 ft) in height, which is more than any other city in the world. Dubai has 73 completed and topped-out buildings that rise at least 200 metres (656 ft) in height. Based on the average height of the ten tallest completed buildings, Dubai has the tallest skyline in the Middle East and the world. As of 2012, the skyline of Dubai is ranked eighth in the world with 248 buildings rising at least 100 metres (330 ft) in height.The history of skyscrapers in Dubai began with the construction of Dubai World Trade Centre in 1979, which is usually regarded as the first high-rise in the city. At the time of its completion, it also stood as the tallest building in the Middle East. Since 1999, and especially from 2005 onwards, Dubai has been the site of an extremely large skyscraper building boom, with all 73 of its buildings over 200 metres (656 ft) tall completed after 1999. In less than ten years, the city has amassed one of the largest skylines in the world; it is now home to the world's tallest building, the world's tallest residence, and the world's second tallest hotel. As of 2019, 49 new skyscrapers are under construction in Dubai; additionally, there are over 127 active high-rise developments that have been proposed for construction in the city. <|endoftext|>  Abu Dhabi (UK: , US: ; Arabic: أَبُو ظَبِي Abū Ẓabī Arabic pronunciation: [ɐˈbuˈðˤɑbi]) is the capital and second-most populous city (after Dubai) of the United Arab Emirates. It is also the capital of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the centre of the Abu Dhabi Metropolitan Area.
The city of Abu Dhabi is located on an island in the Persian Gulf, off the Central West Coast. Most of the city and the Emirate reside on the mainland connected to the rest of the country. As of 2021, Abu Dhabi's urban area had an estimated population of 1.5 million, out of 2.9 million in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, as of 2016. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is headquartered in the city, and was the world's 5th largest sovereign wealth fund in 2021. Abu Dhabi itself has over a trillion US dollars worth of assets under management in a combination of various sovereign wealth funds headquartered there.Abu Dhabi houses local and federal government offices and is the home of the United Arab Emirates Government and the Supreme Petroleum Council. The city is home to the President of the UAE, who is a member of the Al Nahyan family. Abu Dhabi's rapid development and urbanization, coupled with the massive oil and gas reserves and production and relatively high average income, have transformed it into a large, developed metropolis. It is the country's center of politics and industry, and a major culture and commerce center. Abu Dhabi accounts for about two-thirds of the roughly $503 billion UAE economy. <|endoftext|>  Saudi Arabia, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is a country in Southwestern Asia. It covers the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula, and has a land area of about 2,150,000 km2 (830,000 sq mi), making it the fifth-largest country in Asia, the second-largest in the Arab world, and the largest in Western Asia and the Middle East. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the west; Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait to the north; the Persian Gulf, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to the east; Oman to the southeast; and Yemen to the south. Bahrain is an island country off the east coast. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. Its capital and largest city is Riyadh. The country is home to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest cities in Islam.
Pre-Islamic Arabia, the territory that constitutes modern-day Saudi Arabia, was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations; the prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world. The world's second-largest religion, Islam, emerged in what is now Saudi Arabia. In the early 7th century, the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabian Peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632, his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory (from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to parts of Central and South Asia in the east) in a matter of decades. Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750), Abbasid (750–1517), and Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates, as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia, Africa, and Europe.
The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of mainly four distinct historical regions: Hejaz, Najd, and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and South Arabia ('Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud in the West). He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, where political decisions are made on the basis of consultation among the King, the Council of Ministers, and the country’s traditional elites that oversee a highly authoritarian regime. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been described as a "predominant feature of Saudi culture", although the power of the religious establishment has been significantly eroded in the 2010s. In its Basic Law, Saudi Arabia continues to define itself as a sovereign Arab Islamic state with Islam as its official religion, Arabic as its official language, and Riyadh as its capital.
Petroleum was discovered in 1938 and followed up by several other finds in the Eastern Province. Saudi Arabia has since become the world's second-largest oil producer (behind the US) and the world's largest oil exporter, controlling the world's second-largest oil reserves and the fourth-largest gas reserves. The kingdom is categorized as a World Bank high-income economy and is the only Arab country to be part of the G20 major economies. The state has attracted criticism for a variety of reasons, including its role in the Yemeni Civil War, alleged sponsorship of Islamic terrorism and its poor human rights record, including the excessive and often extrajudicial use of capital punishment.Saudi Arabia is considered both a regional and middle power. The Saudi economy is the largest in the Middle East; the world's eighteenth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the seventeenth-largest by PPP. As a country with a very high Human Development Index, it offers a tuition-free university education, no personal income tax, and a free universal health care system. Saudi Arabia is home to the world's third-largest immigrant population. It also has one of the world's youngest populations, with approximately 50 per cent of its population of 34.2 million being under 25 years old. In addition to being a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia is an active and founding member of the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Arab League, Arab Air Carriers Organization and OPEC. <|endoftext|>  The Burj Khalifa (; Arabic: برج خليفة, Arabic pronunciation: [bʊrd͡ʒ xaˈliːfa], Khalifa Tower), known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in 2010, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is known for being the world's tallest building. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009, supplanting Taipei 101, the previous holder of that status.Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the former East German parliament. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It was designed to be the centerpiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building was based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building is named in honor of the former president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the world.
Burj Khalifa was designed by a team led by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm that designed the Sears Tower in Chicago, a previous record holder for the world's tallest building. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation except egress stairs within each of the wings. The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.
At a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers experienced financial problems and required more money and economic funding. Sheikh Khalifa, the then-ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence the changing of the name from "Burj Dubai" to "Burj Khalifa". The concept of profitability derived from building high-density developments and malls around the landmark has proven successful. Its surrounding malls, hotels, and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit.The critical reception of Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards. However, there were numerous complaints concerning migrant workers from South Asia who were the primary building labour force. These centered on low wages and the practice of confiscating passports until duties were complete. <|endoftext|>  Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is home to many extremely tall modern high-rises, 108 of which stand taller than 180 metres (591 ft).

 <|endoftext|>  What discovery in the early 1960s was the impetus for unification of the Emirates? <|endoftext|>  
Prior to the discovery of oil, one of the primary exports of the region had been pearls, an industry that had sustained the sheikhs for millennia. The advent of World War I and the development by the Japanese of cultured pearls all but destroyed the industry.
Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (1918-2004) became the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966 and was the driving force behind the unification of the emirates. With oil interests being lost to U.S. companies, the answer to that problem lay in unifying their interests and protecting their own resources from foreign control. The new constitution was put in place in 1971, forming the UAE from the former 'Trucial States. <|endoftext|>  <|endoftext|>
