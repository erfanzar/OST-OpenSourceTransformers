'Voice Notify' is an essential app for anyone  but especially useful for someone such as myself who has dexterity difficulties  also has a SCI & is a fulltime wheelchair user. I do not have to look at my phone to know what is happening. VN is very customisable  eg  you can stop some FB group messages by putting the group name or a word in the 'ignored text' option in VN settings. Wish 'Email' said who was sending the emails like 'Gmail' does. Unfortunately on my new Note4  VN keeps being 'disabled'!?!
