{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nBecause all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed through space, a wave with a shorter wavelength must have a higher frequency, and vice versa.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nDon sees wavelengths using a spectrometer. A wavelength that is very short likely has a lower or higher frequency compared to a longer one?\n", "completion": "higher<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nAs the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nIf the population of India were to double, their people should expect to have more or less food available?\n", "completion": "less<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nAs humidity increases, the water potential gradient across the inside and outside the leaf become more equal, and so the rate of transpiration decreases.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nJoe noticed that the humidity inside the greenhouse was getting very low, so he turned the sprinklers on to make it more humid. Thus, when the water potential gradient across the inside and outside of the leaf becomes equal, the rate of transpiration will increase or decrease.?\n", "completion": "increase<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nAn object with greater mass or greater velocity has more kinetic energy.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nJohn was watching the particle accelerator and made an observation. The greater an objects mass and velocity, the kinetic energy was Greater or Less?\n", "completion": "Greater<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nBases have pH values above 7. The higher the pH value, the more strongly basic the substance.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nChristy is in lab measuring the pH values of some substances. The first substance she measures has a pH value of 8. The second substance has a pH value of 9. Compared to the first, the second substance can be said to be less. or more basic?\n", "completion": "more<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nIn erosion, the higher the elevation, the farther the stream is from where it will reach base level and the more cutting it has to do.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nA stream going down a mountain will have to do much or little cutting?\n", "completion": "much<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nHigher frequency waves have greater energy.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nWaves that come in very fast to the shores have more energy or less energy?\n", "completion": "more energy<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nWhen we add resistors in parallel to each other the total resistance decreases and the current increases.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nIf current decreases, that means resistance is increasing or decreasing?\n", "completion": "increasing<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nThe greater the mass of the objects, the stronger the gravitational pull between them.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nTwo small planets are near each other, and two large planets are near each other. The smaller planets, compared to the larger planets will have a gravitational pull that is weaker or stronger?\n", "completion": "weaker<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nSo the higher an object is above a surface, the more potential energy it has.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nDane is dropping bouncy balls out of windows. He drops a green ball out of the first story window, then a red ball out of the second story window. The ball with the least potential energy is the red ball or green ball?\n", "completion": "green ball<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Given the fact that:\n\nThe closer together the particles are, the greater the amplitude of the wave.\n\nAnswer the question:\n\n\nDerek is noting how close particles are, and sees that they are very far apart. Since the particles are so far apart, the amplitude of the wave will be greater or lesser?\n", "completion": "lesser<|endoftext|>"}
