Yale proved important as a site for this research. The leaders of these groups were Ross Granville Harrison, Grace E. Pickford, and G. Evelyn Hutchinson, and their members included both graduate students and more experienced scientists.

However, the Han court under Emperor Wu gave Confucianism exclusive patronage. He abolished all academic chairs or erudites (b\u00f3sh\u00ec \u535a\u58eb) not dealing with the Confucian Five Classics in 136 BC and encouraged nominees for office to receive a Confucian-based education at the Imperial University that he established in 124 BC. Unlike the original ideology espoused by Confucius, or Kongzi (551\u2013479 BC), Han Confucianism in Emperor Wu's reign was the creation of Dong Zhongshu (179\u2013104 BC).
