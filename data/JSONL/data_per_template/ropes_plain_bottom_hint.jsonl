{"prompt": "A man put two cups, cup A and cup B, filled with equal amounts of water on to a table and walked away to go check his mail. His son came along and saw the two cups and decided to put some sugar in them to make a tasty drink. The child poured two spoonfuls of sugar into cup A and three spoonfuls of sugar into cup B.\n\nWhich cup has a higher concentration of sugar?\n\nHint: Passive transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane without needing any energy to pass through. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is more concentrated to an area where it is less concentrated. Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. Let's say you dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water. Then you dissolve two teaspoons of salt in another cup of water. The second solution will have a higher concentration of salt.\n", "completion": "cup B<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "There are two cells inside a Petri dish in a laboratory, cell X and cell Z. These cells are from the same organism, but are not the same age. Cell X was created two weeks ago, and cell Z was created one month ago. Therefore, cell Z has had two extra weeks of growth compared to cell X.\n\nWhich cell has a larger volume?\n\nHint: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell\u2019s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell\u2019s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .\n", "completion": "cell Z<|endoftext|>"}

As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect . You\u2019ve probably experienced the Doppler effect yourself. The next time a vehicle with a siren races by, listen for the change in pitch. For an online animation of the Doppler effect, go to the URL below.\n", "completion": "deer<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Scientists have recently discovered two organisms deep in a cave in the hills of Paris. One organism, Boncho, has many enzymes. The other organism, Hojo, has very few enzymes. Currently, scientists are in the process of analyzing these new organisms to learn more about them.\n\nWhich organism will have a harder time creating chemical reactions?\n\nHint: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts.\n", "completion": "Hojo<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "A chef was recently taking inventory of his food when he noticed that identical potatoes were looking different. The chef had purchased them at the same time and they were the same type of potato, but had been stored differently and one of them had spoiled already. Potato A had spots of mold on it, but potato B seemed fresh and ready to cook. The chef was confused.\n\nWhich potato was most likely stored in a cold environment?\n\nHint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures.\n", "completion": "potato B<|endoftext|>"}

Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes.\n", "completion": "Karen<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Jacob has lived in a city in Sweden for most of his life. His favorite hobbies are reading and playing videogames so he rarely goes outside. Even as a kid, he almost never played outside and instead was in his house most of the time. Martin lives in the middle of the Sahara desert in a small town. The sun almost never stops beating down on Martin during the day and it's hard to find shade where he lives.\n\nWho has darker skin?\n\nHint: The epidermis also contains melanocytes, which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D. Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.\n", "completion": "Martin<|endoftext|>"}

{"prompt": "Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive.\n\nWhose cells are dividing more rapidly?\n\nHint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.\n", "completion": "Jason<|endoftext|>"}

This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells.

{"prompt": "There are two neighboring cities, Brampton and Filtroy. The two towns depend on each other by trading supplies and goods regularly. Filtroy is located on top of a very tall mountain, and Brampton is situated at the base of this hill. For this reason, it can sometimes be difficult to traverse the roads to trade goods, but it's important to do it so both cities can thrive.\n\nWhich city has lower air pressure?\n\nHint: Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth\u2019s surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure below . Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level.

At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health.\n", "completion": "Filtroy<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "There are two neighboring cities, Brampton and Filtroy. The two towns depend on each other by trading supplies and goods regularly. Filtroy is located on top of a very tall mountain, and Brampton is situated at the base of this hill. For this reason, it can sometimes be difficult to traverse the roads to trade goods, but it's important to do it so both cities can thrive.\n\nWhich town most likely has citizens with a longer average lifespan?\n\nHint: Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth.

You've probably noticed this effect in high-mountain areas, as it often feels harder to breath.\n", "completion": "Lauren<|endoftext|>"}
{"prompt": "Pam and Angela live in different cities and are talking to each other on the phone while they are sitting outside. Pam lives in Dunder, a city located at sea level, and Angela lives in Mifflin, a city up high in the mountains. Although they don't get to see each other much any more due to the distance between them, they make sure to stay in regular contact.\n\nWhich woman gets more oxygen per single breath?\n\nHint: As shown here, pressure decreases to less than 25% of ground-level atmospheric pressure when we get to an altitude of about six miles.

{"prompt": "Two elementary school classmates, Clarence and Molly, are sitting in the back row of the classroom while the teacher lectures. They are both paying attention and reading what the teacher is writing on the board, but Molly is finding it difficult to read what is on the board since it appears blurry. She asks Clarence if the chalkboard looks blurry and he says that it looks clear to him. Molly will ask her mom about it when she gets home from school today.\n\nWhich child is nearsighted?\n\nHint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.\n", "completion": "Molly<|endoftext|>"}
