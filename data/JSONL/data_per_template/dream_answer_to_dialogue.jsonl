I worry a bit about getting old and I'd like to prove to myself that I'm still almost as fit as I was twenty years ago. I'm interested in climbing as well as running. I'll never become an expert climber, but I know what I'm doing in the mountains. I successfully completed a course in snow and ice climbing when I was younger, and I've done a series of easy climbs in the Alps during the last few years. My wife doesn't share my interest in mountains.

While I'm running I think about all sorts of things, and at the end of a run I'm sometimes surprised to find that I've managed to solve a problem that was on my mind. Next year I'm going to try the London Marathon. It's a long, hard race - 26 miles, or 42 kilometres - and you have to be tough to finish, but I very much want to do it. I worry a bit about getting old and I'd like to prove to myself that I'm still almost as fit as I was twenty years ago. I'm interested in climbing as well as running. I'll never become an expert climber, but I know what I'm doing in the mountains. I successfully completed a course in snow and ice climbing when I was younger, and I've done a series of easy climbs in the Alps during the last few years. My wife doesn't share my interest in mountains. She agreed to go climbing with me once, but she found that she felt ill as soon as she got above 1000 metres, so we decide to follow different hobbies.\n\nW: You certainly seem to enjoy various types of recreation.
