The findings will be detailed by researchers from Belgium's Ghent University and the University of Ghana at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver, and center around how antioxidant-rich the sweet is. As a press release explains, it all comes down to tweaking the process. Cocoa beans are removed from pods, fermented in baskets, sun-dried, and then roasted. It's during that last step, the roasting, that polyphenols, which act as antioxidants, are partially lost. In a bid to up the polyphenol content, researchers added a nontraditional step that \"makes our research fundamentally different,\" explains Emmanuel Ohene Afoakwa: pulp preconditioning. That simply means they stored the pods\u2014in the case of their experiments, for zero, three, seven, or 10 days\u2014before removing the beans and beginning the fermentation process. A sweet pulp rests between the pod and the beans, and Afoakwa believes the preconditioning gives the pulp time to affect those beans. Indeed, the researchers found that those stored for a week showed the highest antioxidant activity after roasting\u2014which they also adjusted. Rather than heat the beans for the typical 10 to 20 minutes at 248-266 degrees, they lowered the temp to 242 and upped the roasting time to 45 minutes, and discovered that slower and lower was also best in terms of antioxidant activity. The researchers' abstract notes another benefit: \"Pulp preconditioning and roasting duration could be used to reduce the astringency and bitterness,\" improving chocolate's flavor.

But some of the healthful polyphenols (antioxidants) are lost during the roasting process, so the researchers wanted to figure out a way to retain as much of the polyphenols and good flavors as possible. \n \n \"We decided to add a pod-storage step before the beans were even fermented to see whether that would have an effect on the polyphenol content,\" says Emmanuel Ohene Afoakwa, Ph.D., who is at the University of Ghana. \"This is not traditionally done, and this is what makes our research fundamentally different. It's also not known how roasting affects polyphenol content.\" \n \n Afoakwa's team divided 300 pods into four groups that were either not stored at all or stored for three, seven or 10 days before processing.

Many eventual recruits appear to be joining online social networks before becoming members of an established hate group. \n \n And as organized hate groups recruit and centralize in relative obscurity online before ever manifesting \u201cirl\u201d (\u201cin real life\u201d), the void of domestic efforts to counter radicalization grows as fast as young potential recruits move across the web and transition between apps. \n \n In less than a year, AWD has proven how young men, some in their teens and early 20s, can steepen the arc of their own radicalization when they gather together. The group has also attracted peers via slick, sophisticated digital propaganda, much of which directed traffic to Iron March (IM) before that forum was taken offline in the fall of 2017. \n \n Though it has been in existence since at least October 2015, AWD is only now grabbing headlines, as five murders have been linked to either members, like Devon Arthurs, 18; alleged members, like Samuel Woodward, 20; or individuals, like Nicholas Giampa, 17, who associated closely with the group online. \n \n Giampa stands accused of executing his girlfriend\u2019s parents, Buckley Kuhn-Fricker, 43, and Scott Fricker, 48.

Researchers think they can make a vaccine patterned on their blood, Paul Rodgers at Forbes explains.

The U.S. economy is in its 10th year of expansion, the second-longest such period on record, and October marked the 100th straight month of hiring, a record streak. \n \n The resulting strength in customer demand has led companies to steadily add workers. Though economists predict that hiring will eventually slow as the pool of unemployed Americans dwindles, there's no sign of that happening yet. \n \n Still, the latest month of healthy job growth might...<|endoftext|>"}

One of the biggest shockers from the event: Research in Motion is scrapping its name, and will now be known simply as BlackBerry. Other developments: CEO Thorsten Heins underscored the \"heartfelt and brutal honesty\" BlackBerry had to go through to get to this day, reports Forbes. It's been a long haul for the phone, which is debuting nearly a year late. Heins showcased two phones: the Z10, which has a full 4.2-inch touchscreen, and the Q10, which has a traditional keyboard set below a smaller touchscreen. Heins said the Q10 was created for customers \"that said we just have to have a physical keyboarding experience,\" reports USA Today. The company also added some star power, announcing that Alicia Keys would be its new Global Creative director, a position created for her, the Verge reports. The company also boasted that Neil Gaiman and Robert Rodriguez will be using the phone for a film and art/storytelling project. On to the features. First up was BlackBerry Hub, the central interface for the Z10. It has a tiled layout not unlike Microsoft's latest Windows iteration. BlackBerry software honcho Vivek Bhardwaj also showed off BlackBerry Peek, the phone's notification system, which allows users to check emails and calendars without leaving the app they're using. Bhardwaj also discussed the hotly anticipated BlackBerry Balance feature, which aims to reinstate BlackBerry's dominance among business users. It allows users to maintain a personal profile on the phone, while a company can access the phone's professional profile. As for hardware, BlackBerry's camera now allows for face-to-face messaging. The Z10 will be available in black and white, and ZDNet notes prices will hover around $149 for a three-month contract, depending on the carrier. The phones will be available tomorrow in the UK, but the US will have to cool its heel until March.\n", "completion": "BlackBerry has announced a new position, Global Creative Director, and hired its own in-house celebrity to fill the role: Alicia Keys.

Keys, meanwhile, will be taking the BlackBerry on tour and will use it to create a music video for every city she visits.

The super PACs in question are only a week old, and it's unprecedented to have raised so much so quickly. So who's behind the money? The New York Times identifies the main player as a \"reclusive Long Islander\" named Robert Mercer. Mercer began his career at IBM but now runs a hedge fund called Renaissance Technologies, and like the Koch brothers and Sheldon Adelson, he is taking advantage of the Citizens United case that loosened restrictions on wealthy donors. He's \"a very low-profile guy, but he\u2019s becoming a bigger and bigger player,\u201d says one campaign finance expert.

The whole thing was livestreamed around the world. And, as with most things having to do with Kanye West, it was all the Internet was talking about. Here are five things you need to know about Kanye's day: It was huge. The Verge reports more than 20 million tried to watch the stream of the nearly two-hour event at one time. \"The early viewership numbers are insane\u2026There aren't many other musicians who could pull this off.\" Lamar Odom was there. It was the former NBA player's first public appearance since nearly dying following an overdose at a Nevada brothel in October, according to People. Odom continues to recover from his coma and sat with estranged wife Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian after entering with the rest of West's family. Kanye made a video game. The Verge reports it's called Only One and depicts his late mother \"traveling through the gates of heaven,\" apparently alternating between her own set of wings and a pegasus. West says a lot of people turned down his pitch for the game. Martin Shkreli tried to steal his thunder. The legally troubled \"pharma bro\" offered West $10 million for The Life of Pablo, hoping to delay or prevent its release to the public, according to the New York Times. \"Instead of releasing this product for your millions of fans, I ask you to sell this recording solely to me,\" Shkreli tweeted. \"I believe you (and your partners) will find this financial arrangement more attractive than your current course of action.\" Kanye is still super quotable.

Set in royally screwed-up Los Angeles (home to the masses) and an idyllic space station in the clouds (home to the rich) circa 2154, this flick from Neill Blomkamp (District 9) has both the compelling themes and action-packed fight scenes to make it a summer blockbuster. So is it one? Critics are split. The action sequences, complete with \"futuristic CGI flying machines\" are impressive, but it's \"Blomkamp's critique of a society riven by class and racial differences\" that sets it apart, Soren Anderson writes for the Seattle Times. \"Few mainstream moviemakers have painted as sprawling and densely detailed a portrait of humanity in extremis as Blomkamp does here.\" But at the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan's high hopes were dashed. \"Elysium is no promised land.\" Though Matt Damon is great as always and the visuals are equally as impressive, \"the film doesn't feel as singular as we would have hoped.\" District 9 did a much better job of connecting genre (sci-fi) and theme (\"socio-political concerns\"). Even with the talented Damon along for the ride, Dana Stephens at Slate writes Elysium \"does a little, sometimes shockingly little, with a lot ...

Well, it turns out the sound of an actual ticking clock can speed up your reproductive timing, making you want to have babies earlier, according to a new study published in Springer's journal Human Nature. Researchers asked men and women questions about their reproductive attitudes\u2014things like when they'd like to marry and have kids and how much they'd be willing to alter their \"requirements\" for a mate in order to start a family earlier\u2014and they found that the sound of a ticking clock influenced women's answers, possibly because it made them think about the passage of time. \"The very subtle sound prime of a ticking clock changed the timing with which women sought to have children and the traits they sought in potential partners\u2014both central aspects of women\u2019s mating-related psychology,\" says one of the lead researchers.

This is according to Justin Moss and Jon Maner of Florida State University in the US. \n \n Reproductive timing refers to the time frame and the specific years during which people begin to focus their energy and resources towards bearing and caring for their offspring. Some researchers reason that when and how this happens is greatly influenced by a person\u2019s childhood years, his or her socio-economic background, and other subtle environmental factors. \n \n Moss and Maner completed two experiments to test the influence of a subtle environmental factor \u2013 the ticking of a small white kitchen clock \u2013 on people\u2019s reproductive timing attitudes.

When the researchers plotted the data from 2001 to 2015, the divorce spike in those two months was both striking and consistent, they write in a press release. And while that data comes exclusively from Washington state, it seems to apply nationwide. The researchers followed up with a look at data from Ohio, Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona, and found the same pattern. So what's going on? They think winter holidays and summer vacations are a big factor. These are both \"culturally sacred times for families,\" says associate sociology professor Julie Brines, per the UW release. That is, couples may be reluctant to split around Christmas, or just ahead of an annual vacation, and instead view those times instead as an opportunity to mend a troubled relationship. \"One last shot,\" as Brines puts it, per the Atlantic.

Following strange calls from orcas off the northeastern coast of British Columbia's Vancouver Island in December, researchers observed the first known case of infanticide among the whales. After tracking down the orcas and hearing a ruckus in the water, the scientists spotted a male orca with a newborn calf in its mouth, being chased by the calf's mother and other members of its family. As the male's mother attempted to intervene, the calf's mother \"hit the male so hard that ... his blubber was shaking on his body and you could see blood flying through the air,\" ecologist Jared Towers tells the CBC. \"We were really quite horrified and fascinated.\" The male still didn't let go of the calf, which had died by that point, according to Newsweek. Researchers, describing the case in Scientific Reports, say the male orca likely killed the calf so the male orca could mate with the infant's mother. In other mammals, infanticide \"forces the infant's mom into a fertile state much quicker,\" Towers says. He adds researchers previously thought female orcas were picky about mates, but this behavior suggests \"females don't have a lot of choice when it comes to breeding.\" The CBC notes $9 million the Canadian government has dedicated to orca research may reveal more about the endangered species in time, as Washington state works on protection, per Time.

Curtis Dawkins' debut, The Graybar Hotel, was published in July by Scribner and details life behind bars in ways that have thrilled readers. Michigan's Department of Treasury is less enthused, however, and has filed a court complaint that asks that 90% of the convicted killer's reported $150,000 advance be given to the state as payment for the cost of his imprisonment. Michigan's attorney general reportedly filed the complaint, which states that Dawkins is not entitled to the money or to transfer any of it to his family, not long after his victim's brother complained publicly about the book deal, per the Guardian. Because he cannot afford an attorney, Dawkins is scheduled to defend himself in the case. Dawkins has in the past expressed remorse for the 2004 botched robbery that led to the murder of Thomas Bowman. The New York Times reports he intends to argue that the same law the attorney general says allows the state to keep the profits also stipulates that courts must consider a convict's obligation to provide for his children or spouse when deciding such cases. Michigan is one of some 40 states with laws on the books that allow the government to force inmates to pay for incarceration.

Woodlawn hitchhiked back to New York at 16, where she was a go-go dancer, among other things: \"I was turning tricks, living off the streets and wondering when my next meal was coming,\" she wrote in her 1991 memoir.

The new, larger study out of Amsterdam's VU University Medical Center disputes that belief. Researchers looked at 479 women getting IUI, most of whom got multiple rounds; they collected information on nearly 2,000 cycles overall.

The GAO report, which Inside Higher Ed says is \"highly critical,\" looked at the federal government's income-driven repayment plans, which cap borrowers' monthly payments based on their income and, in some cases, ultimately forgive the balance of the debt entirely. Currently, $355 billion is owed under income-driven repayment plans, and the GAO report found that $137 billion of that will never be repaid.

The new finding traces the tunnel from entrance to exit and provides evidence to support survivor accounts of the harrowing effort to escape the holding pit.<|endoftext|>"}

With last year's quiet launch of a service called Price Promise, the car shopping website is trying to \"be as close as possible to Amazon.com for the automotive experience,\" president Seth Berkowitz explained at an industry gathering yesterday. What that means, per the Detroit Free Press: Berkowitz says car shoppers' No. 1 gripe is the lack of a clear, exact car price; Price Promise cuts out the haggling that follows as a result by allowing dealers to email the exact price of a vehicle found on the site to shoppers who request it. Shoppers can then print out a certificate bearing the number; the dealer must sell the car for that price. Ergo, no haggling. Though the site hopes the feature will set it apart from the competition, TrueCar.com has offered a similar program since 2009, the Free Press notes; it claims 6,200 participating dealers, to Edmunds.com's 600. The service also doesn't factor in a buyer's credit history, which could change the monthly payments, points out the Wall Street Journal. Price Promise doesn't necessarily meaning getting the lowest price, either. Dealers say they sell cars to Price-Promise users for $300 to $500 more than traditional buyers.

On Thursday, Farrow appeared on CBS This Morning and says she wishes there'd been a trial since \"I was already traumatized\" from the alleged assault on August 4, 1992. That's when Farrow says her \"hero\" led her to the attic of Mia Farrow's Connecticut residence and \"touched my labia and my vulva with his finger.\" Dylan Farrow was 7 at the time. The now-32-year-old mom told interviewer Gayle King she felt it was necessary to finally come forward on TV, saying, \"I want to show my face and tell my story. ... I want to speak out. Literally.\" And she has supporters in high places, including Mira Sorvino and Natalie Portman, per Time.

{"prompt": "Write an expanded news article with plausible details from the following summary:\nAn alimony deduction to be erased in 2019 under the new tax plan has lawyers preparing for a wave of divorces this year\u2014and eying complications for recipients beyond. Payers have long received a tax break on alimony, while recipients have paid income tax on payments. But after Dec. 31, 2018, alimony will no longer be deductible for the payer, and recipients won't need to pay income tax on it, reports Politico. While this will help recipients\u2014primarily women\u2014in one sense, they'll suffer in other ways. As lawyer Madeline Marzano-Lesnevich tells Yahoo, a man in the highest income-tax bracket who pays his wife $100,000 in alimony in 2018 ($85,000 for the woman after taxes) actually pays about $60,000 with the deduction. Without it, he might argue $60,000 is all he can afford to pay, leaving the wife with $25,000 less than before. Attorneys predict the change will complicate divorce negotiations and lead to more cases being heard in court. But some say women will be disproportionally injured by it. \"The repeal reduces the bargaining power of vulnerable spouses, mostly women, in achieving financial stability after a divorce,\" a lawyer tells Politico. Others point out alimony recipients may have a harder time saving for retirement as contributions to retirement accounts often have to come from taxed income, per CNBC. Marzano-Lesnevich says her firm has already had \"a rush of clients \u2026 demanding we get them divorced immediately\" to avoid such complications in 2019. More couples are expected to follow suit this year. Politico reports removing the deduction is expected to raise $6.9 billion over the next decade and help offset the cost of tax cuts outlined in the GOP bill.\n", "completion": "People typically rush into marriage, not divorces. But a curious change in the GOP\u2019s tax bill means that some couples \u2014 or individuals \u2014 might rush back to the courthouse. \n \n The GOP tax bill signed by Trump late last year fundamentally altered many aspects of the tax code, sending accountants scrambling, and stands as the biggest change to the tax system since 1986. Despite long-standing calls to address the federal debt, the tax cuts outlined in the bill came out to be pricey, projected to cost $1.5 trillion or more, with insufficient revenue gains to pay for it. \n \n One way the Republican bill writers tried to raise revenue to compensate for the cuts was through alimony. Under the new bill, alimony paid by one spouse to the other will not be tax deductible, and the spouse receiving the alimony no longer has to pay taxes on it. In the current system, it works the opposite way, with the payer deducting the full amount and the recipient paying taxes on the alimony at a rate of 15%. The new rule means the government will end up with more of a divorcing pair\u2019s combined money. \n \n When news dropped that this might be included in the bill in November, things got crazy. \n \n \u201cWhen everyone thought the deduction deadline was going to be Dec. 31, we had a rush of clients,\u201d said Madeline Marzano-Lesnevich, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers. \u201cAll of a sudden we had clients who were going to be receiving alimony demanding we get them divorced immediately.\u201d \n \n Ultimately the law won\u2019t take effect until next year, giving divorcing couples a reprieve.

That patron, Murat Bliev, was a member of a St. Petersburg cheat group, a willing participant in what Koerner describes as a \"hotbed of slots-related malfeasance.\" This underground movement originated in 2009, when then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided to make most gambling illegal to curb organized crime. All of the slot machines in Russian casinos had to go somewhere, and so many of them ended up with high bidders (including Bliev's organization), who then poked around in the machines' coding to figure out how to exploit them. How the racket-runners worked: They figured out the patterns behind the machines' pseudorandom number generators, or PRNGs, which, while difficult to crack, aren't impossible if someone can get into the machine's insides. But because the \"temporal state\" of each machine is different, additional surveillance steps were needed in combination with the PRNG intel\u2014and a casino security expert figured out how the hackers pulled it off.

{"prompt": "Write an expanded news article with plausible details from the following summary:\nRand Paul's resounding Senate win in Kentucky's GOP primary represents a major upset for the Republican Party and a major victory for the Tea Party movement. Paul\u2014who led opponent Trey Grayson by 59% to 35% with 89% of precincts reported\u2014tapped into voter anger at Washington far more successfully than Grayson, notes Manu Raju at Politico, predicting the win will send shockwaves through the Republican Party nationwide. Much about Paul's win was specific to Kentucky, however, Joshua Green writes in the Atlantic, arguing that last night's result doesn't necessarily signal major Tea Party gains this fall. The Kentucky primary was closed, he notes, so there's no sign that Independents or Democrats will back a Tea Party candidate. Paul also had the support of a celebrity dad who brought name recognition, money, and volunteers, and faced an opponent whose family members were well-known Democratic fundraisers until recently.\n", "completion": "Congratulations to Rand Paul and his campaign--this was a big win. But it might not be quite as meaningful as it's being made out to be. There was a lot about it that was specific to Kentucky politics, and just because a Tea Partier won in Kentucky, doesn't necessarily mean the Tea Party will fare as well elsewhere this fall. Here are six things to consider: \n \n 1) Kentucky has a closed GOP primary. Conservatives were willing to support a Tea Party candidate--but we don't yet know if indies and Dems will be, here or elsewhere. \n \n 2) Kentucky's GOP is split into factions. Last night's results showed only that the Paul/Bunning wing was stronger than the McConnell/ Fletcher wing. \n \n 3) Paul's celebrity dad brought him money, volunteers, name recognition, and media attention, particularly on Fox News. What other Tea Party candidate can match that? \n \n \n \n 4) It was well known among Kentucky GOPers that Trey Grayson was a Bill Clinton supporter and volunteer, and a member of the Harvard College Democrats. \n \n 5) The Grayson family were notable Democratic fundraisers until they sensed the climate shifting in northern Kentucky, and the whole state shifting toward the GOP. They're not beloved. \n \n 6) Grayson's political maneuvering backfired disastrously. He was a Bunning protege, then stabbed his patron in the back by forming an exploratory committee before Bunning dropped out. Bunning then endorsed Paul. Nobody likes a man in a hurry. \n \n UPDATE: Bonus 7) Democratic turnout was much, MUCH higher than Republican turnout. \n \n \n \n We want to hear what you think about this article.
