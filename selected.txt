He should be honest as say how he feels, so we all would know the truth, instead of what they have told him to say!!

[SEP] It appears that our country is in a lull when it comes to being willing to vote. [SEP] I know. I think Ms. McDonald may take it really seriously but I can unserstand why. A lot of woman worked really hard for the right to vote.

So the bigger planets suck the smaller ones in and consume them.

[SEP] Hi , do you like to travel?[SEP] I do. I don't do it often enough but I really love going to new places. Did you know that instead of fetching baggage faster, airports just make you walk longer. It helps to stop the complaints.

[SEP] I love this time of year.  Baseball is just around the corner.  Are you a baseball fan?[SEP] I LOVE baseball!! Did you know the reason baseball managers wear uniforms because they are technically able to play for their teams if the need arises. I think that would be a sight to see!
[SEP] Do you like drama?[SEP] I love it. Do you ever watch House MD?

[SEP] Did you know that Hugh laurie is the highest paid actor ever for tv drama, earning $700,000 per episode in house[SEP] Interesting factoid. I remember that show.

[SEP] What do you think about Pluto not being a Planet? To me it seems kind of disrespectful. [SEP] I think it does too. I will always think of Pluto as a planet.  There's a lot of odd things with planets. Uranus rotates on it's side so should that mean it's not a planet?
