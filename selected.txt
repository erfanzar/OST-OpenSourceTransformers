He should be honest as say how he feels, so we all would know the truth, instead of what they have told him to say!!

[SEP] It appears that our country is in a lull when it comes to being willing to vote. [SEP] I know. I think Ms. McDonald may take it really seriously but I can unserstand why. A lot of woman worked really hard for the right to vote.

So the bigger planets suck the smaller ones in and consume them.
