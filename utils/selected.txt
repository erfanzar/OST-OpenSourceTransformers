And since the grand jury decided to not indict Darren Wilson for his murdering Michael Brown it caused so many protests, I don't think it was right. There was so much media about it on Facebook it was crazy!

[SEP] I've got to admit that I was one of the people ridiculing Kim K for visiting the white house, but after hearing more about what she accomplished, I have more respect for her. How do you feel?[SEP] I agree that here accomplishments merit some degree of respect. I wonder why people would choose to ridicule her
[SEP] Hello, what are your thought on Trump, do you like him as president?[SEP] I try to support all Presidents. I feel like he gets a lot of flack. 
[SEP] Did you hear about the first crash of an F-35 aircraft?[SEP] Yes I did. It was the first crash of an F-35 aircraft in about 17 years. I wonder what the cause of the crash was, they won't say

[SEP] Hi! Do you feel Trump's maximum pressure approach played a role in getting Kim Jong Un to the bargaining table? I'm torn on the issue as I also feel policy played a role as well.[SEP] I definitely feel Trump's maximum pressure approach was at play.

[SEP] Hey what's up. How do you feel about Trump?

[SEP] I was reading an article and it stated that our White House has twin buildings in Ireland and France. I thought that was interesting[SEP] I think so too! I never really thought the white house would be replicated anywhere else. I wonder why the white house still uses floppy disks to store files?
[SEP] Do you ever play golf?  It can be a fun, but very challenging sport.[SEP] Yes, I do, but not very often. The cost of playing is prohibitive for me. I don't have a private golf course like Trump, nor am I a millionaire like many of our former presidents.

[SEP] Unfortunately, at the Youth Peace Center in Chicago a person spoke of being shot six times in the back of the head. "It was like Iraq", the person said, but he hasn't been in Iraq.[SEP] What a sad day. Also the day of the Parkland, FL shooting. WHat is wrong with people these days?
[SEP] Have you heard of the Chicago massacre? People compared it to war. Chicago has a high murder rate.[SEP] Yes it's a shame.I think that the tearing down of the high rise public housing caused the diffusion of gang problems into other neighborhoods.
[SEP] How's it going, did you know Karl Benz was the first person to patent the car?[SEP] I didn't.  It makes sense... Did you know that McDonald's developed drive-thus to help soldiers?  I helped me too.

Wow.[SEP] Yes, that says a lot about both things doesn't it?  I agree, my phone is my lifeline as well.  It's funny how vulnerable they seem to be.

[SEP] How's it going, do you watch youtube? It was created in 2005[SEP] I do, Google owns the company right?
[SEP] I know the article is good but "home buyers who focus on their personal finances are going to be the winners, because they will have the means to make fast, substantial offers"... no duh![SEP] I know, right?

[SEP] Hey there what do you think about Kanye West?[SEP] I think Kanye needs to see a mental health professional, as those around him are not giving him the help he needs. That "dragon energy" bit was bizarre, but he was on to something with that hydrogen power that everyone glossed over.
[SEP] Hi there! How are you doing this fine Internet evening?[SEP] Hi! I'm just catching up on some reading and saw that Chance the Rapper received backlash for sharing his opinion about not needing to support Democrats.

[SEP] Aretha Franklin's passing was quite a big deal from history, art, society, music on a lot of levels.[SEP] She was amazing. I heard her funeral was quite a production. She was carried in the same white cadillac that carried Rosa Parks and her father Rev. CL Franklin

[SEP] How's it going? Have you heard about the two nooses found at the Mississippi State Capitol? How appalling[SEP] Hello! Yes I have heard it, it's terrible.

[SEP] Hi, how are you?[SEP] I'm great! Do you listen to the radio?
[SEP] Hello.  Anybody there?  I am trapped in the US Senate chamber and I can't get out![SEP] Ok, it might be awhile, you know how slow they are to move in Washington. Lol

[SEP] Do you follow US politics?[SEP] Yes I think it's important to stay up-to-date. The Republican Party currently controls the presidency. Or should I say the Grand Old Party!
[SEP] Hello - did you know the top 3 wealthiest presidents in US history were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson?[SEP] I've heard that. It's hard to believe that Trump isn't even in the top. 
[SEP] Good morning! Do you like politics?[SEP] Hi, tricky question.  I like following political news but talking it can sometimes be difficult.
[SEP] Do you think it is OK for the opposing party to criticize past presidents?[SEP] I am not sure, I think instead of bringing people down by bringing up negative stuff about other people,  that people should just say positive things about themselves. 
[SEP] hey there, do you know much about us politics?[SEP] somewhat, lets talk about the senate. they used the same gavel for 165 years until nixon cracked it
[SEP] How are you? Did you know the Republican party was founded in 1854?[SEP] Never knew that! It was founded by anti-slavery activists, economic modernizers, ex-National Republicans, ex-Free Soilers and Whigs. It seems to have changed though. 
[SEP] Did you know the Republican Party is also referred to as the GOP (Grand Old Party)?[SEP] I've heard that. It's crazy to think that there hasn't been a president who wasn't democrat or republican since 1853. Maybe time for more than two parties?
[SEP] Have you heard of the idiots who hung nooses outside the Capitol building in Mississippi?[SEP] I did, that was absolutely awful, I don't think they have found them yet.
[SEP] Hello, are you particularly interested in politics?[SEP] I am very interested in politics, though it's hard to stay keep up with Trump, Pence, and most of the Republican party these days.

[SEP] do you know much about the us senate?[SEP] Yes I know that they had the same gavel for 165 years until Nixon broke it
[SEP] The Virginia House trying to expand medicare using Trump and Pence is an odd occurance[SEP] I agree. House Speaker M. Kirkland Cox (R-Colonial Heights) contends that expanding the federal-state health-care program during the Trump administration offers the "best chance for conservative reforms."
[SEP] Are you familiar with the US elected positions like the senate or president?[SEP] Yes.  I know the U.S. senate just had  a runoff featuring a black democrat.
[SEP] Hello there, do you know much about politics in general?[SEP] Yes I follow it a lot.  It is awful what Republican leaders are doing.  They will not stand up to Trump at all.
[SEP] did you know that Trump wouldn't be in the top 3 wealthiest presidents? Like that must be adjusted for inflation[SEP] I did not. That would be an interesting thing to look into. Speaking of presidents, did you know that the first president of Zimbabwe was called President Banana?
[SEP] Hey there. The President is something else, huh. He sure travels all over too.[SEP] yes he is always on news 
[SEP] Do you follow politics much? Every once in a while I'll see an article that catches my eye[SEP] Yeah from time to time. Do you know much about the Senate in the US?

[SEP] Do you think that the American culture doesn't prioritize families? Are parent doing their job?[SEP] I think there is less and less prioritizing on families and family life as time goes on. 
[SEP] Meagan Duhamel and Eric Radford seemed really skilled, they won a lot of titles.[SEP] what are they skilled at?

[SEP] The president sure does an important job[SEP] Some might say he does a bad job at an important job lol. It's too bad there's not a backup to balance out his worse impulses; until 1805, the runner-up in the election became VP.

[SEP] Hello, Cars are certainly popular throughout many places of the world. Did you know that in South Africa it is legal to equip your car with a flame thrower to prevent carjacking. Wow![SEP] Yes, that is quite interesting since they can be dangerous. Do you know how cadillac got its name?

[SEP] Hello. What do you think of the universe?[SEP] Well, I think it's vast and that our human minds can't even begin to comprehend it.
[SEP] Hey there!  Are you a basketball fan?  I am Bulls fan and we stink!  We are probably as good as the Lakers though which is funny since they had such high expectations.[SEP] I'm a little bit of a fan. I watch some of the Spurs games.  Have you heard of Tim Duncan?

[SEP] Hello do you know much about the presidents?[SEP] Yeah here and there. DO you know who the three wealthiest ones in the US are?
[SEP] I think it is interesting that the President is not just a term for the US.  Many other countries have Presidents too[SEP] Interesting I know Guatemala is one that does this.  I wonder what some other ones are.
[SEP] Hi! Are you a voter?[SEP] Yea, it's pretty crazy a chimpanzee got 400,000 votes in a mayoral election
[SEP] do you know much about presidents?[SEP] I know some stuff, like who the three wealthiest guys are so far, and you?

[SEP] Hi!  Do you follow politics?[SEP] Yes. Vote, too. You?
[SEP] Did you know the president of Indoensia has released 3 pop albums while in office? [SEP] That is pretty wild, it would be like Trump doing more Celebrity Apprentice shows.

[SEP] Did you ever go to college? What are the skills that you think we're the most necessary to your success[SEP] I did.  What you learn in college is very different from what you need for real life success.  Like how to buy a house, insurance, medical stuff...

[SEP] Hiya Turkey[SEP] Hey there do you like football? My favorite team is the Patriots

[SEP] Did you hear how the government was planning on destroying wikileaks? It was published on their website.[SEP] I did hear about that.

Also scary is that the Chinese government censor the word for censorship, that's how you know you're screwed LOL
[SEP] Do you sense that we now have a space race among private companies?[SEP] I do.I find the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, which includes Space X, to be a big indicator that space flight is being privatized.

Talk about deterrent!

[SEP] Do you have a favorite Netflix show? They've come so far since Lilyhammer.[SEP] Honestly, the subscription is worth it just for the OFfice sometimes. Did you know they account for 33% of all bandwidth at night?
[SEP] Hi, do you like television?[SEP] I like it, some shows more than others.  How about you?
[SEP] Netflix is an American media service found in 1997 by Reed hastings and Marc randolph.[SEP] That's quite interesting. Do you have a Netflix subscription?
[SEP] Have you heard about the Orange is the New Black Cancellation?  They are cancelling after seven seasons.[SEP] i guess they ran out of stories. i dont really know the show. seven seasons? that is a good run.
[SEP] Have you watched "13 Reasons Why" on Netflix?[SEP] I have not, but lets talk about Netflix. They spend a lot of money on postage, even more then bandwidth 
[SEP] So Mo'Nique is boycotting Netflix?[SEP] Yea, I guess she wanted more money.
[SEP] Hey!  Wach any good Netflix movies lately?[SEP] I did not watch 13 reasons why, but i do like Jessica Jones
[SEP] Hi. Do you watch Netflix?[SEP] Hi. I used to.  Do you watch Netflix?

[SEP] Hello, are you particularly interested in politics?[SEP] I try to stay out of politics but unfortunately I do get sucked into it sometimes haha. I did see that Wikileaks was going to be destroyed by the US government apparently, and then Wikileaks leak that plan haha that's so crazy
[SEP] hey my friend do you watch TV?[SEP] I do like watching TV, do you have any favorite shows?
[SEP] Hi! Can you believe the three wealthiest presidents of all time were Jefferson, Washington and JFK?[SEP] Hi! Washington and jFK makes sense, this is probably a bit out of date (i.e., Trump). The president of indonesia released 3 pop albums in office. Multi talented!
[SEP] Good morning!  Do you like to play any video games?[SEP] I do, its one of my favorite activities, do you?
[SEP] Hey![SEP] How are you today?
[SEP] Theres a store in alabama that sells items left at airports[SEP] Wouldn't that be fun to go to?

[SEP] Hello Friend.  Do you want to talk about clothing?  Did you know that Pilgrim clothing was full of color and that they only wore black for special occasions?

[SEP] Do you know what the highest scoring football game was?[SEP] No, 150-ish  ?
[SEP] Hello and good morning. You a basketball fan? I used to play a lot. I like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar he was very dominant. His dunk was crazy.[SEP] Yes I am a basketball fan. I follow the NBA more than I follow college basketball. Who is your favorite team?
[SEP] There are so very odd facts about the united states government. I wonder if the same can be said for other countries. [SEP] I'm sure there is. I find it odd that every US president with a beard has been Republican. 
[SEP] Hello! Do you have a favorite football team?[SEP] hi, how are you? no i dont. i dont really know the sport well. You?
[SEP] Hi!  Do you follow the government?[SEP] A little the Republican party is also called the GOP.
[SEP] Hello there![SEP] Hello, do you know Paul Manafort, former Trump campain chairman
[SEP] Hi, how are you? What do you think of government?[SEP] I like it but do not like some of the players. You?
[SEP] Do you consume the news a lot?[SEP] Not really. I don't like all the negativity although I am guilty of getting news form social media like facebook.
[SEP] What are your thoughs on media?[SEP] I think it's very important for people to stay informed and also as equally important to not be biased by what you see and that certain publications are biased vs others, what about you?
[SEP] Good morning! Are you a fan of football?[SEP] Good morning. Yes. which is your favourite football team ?
[SEP] do you like the band Kiss? I like them a lot, I guess they bought into an arena football team[SEP] I do enjoy their music.  I think its cool that they offered a contract to Tim Tebow to play.
[SEP] Have you heard that Trump is apparently worried over the Manafort trial? It's been in the news lately.[SEP] Yeah, Paul Manafort is quite the character, as is Trump. Trump was evidently quoted saying he didn't understand why the government didn't tell him Manafort was under investigation.
[SEP] What do you think about the company Trump keeps like Paul manafort?[SEP] I think it is questionable.  Obviously the problem is two-fold for Trump.  The types he associates with and when he endorses someone, that stamp of approval does not mean much.
[SEP] Hi! Are you a football fan?[SEP] I watch some football on occasion.
[SEP] Hi! Do you follow the government at all? I find it awfully ironic that Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy them. Ha![SEP] I've always followed the government closely. Unfortunately it's become a reality show lately so it's been even easier to follow. Ha - Assange is never getting out of Ecuador.

[SEP] "The mistrust of the media is so extreme among Republicans that 40 percent consider otherwise accurate news stories to be "fake news" if the stories cast a politician or political group in a negative light. " I find that number to be really more than I thought...[SEP] Do you think the news is fake?
[SEP] Hello,  hows it going?  did you know the Presidents guest house is bigger than the white house?  That is crazy![SEP] I did hear that. pomp and circumstance. Apparently the president of Indonesia has 3 pop album. 
[SEP] Iowa's guest locker room for football teams is painted pink, hilarious![SEP] LOL.  I know all about it being a Nebraska fan who has had teams play there!  Are you a fan of football?
[SEP] do you know much about presidents?[SEP] I know some stuff. DO you know who are the three wealthiest us presidents?
[SEP] Do you get a lot of news from the media?[SEP] I try to stick with larger media outlets.  I follow news aggregators, like Drudge and then for issues I am interested, I get info from different sources to weed out biases.  Media is still important but needs to report more and opine less.  I think that's the gist of the Gallup poll.  Your thoughts?
[SEP] Episcopal High School is great for learning football and bonding as a team.  It is very diverse as well.[SEP] Yeah I heard it is a good school.  I guess the student population there is 445. 
[SEP] Hello. How are you?[SEP] Hey!  I am doing well, enjoying my Sunday.  How are you?  Getting ready to watch some college basketball this afternoon.  The brainchild of James Naismith! Are you a fan?

[SEP] Hey! Did you hear that actress Charlotte Rae passed, she was the house mother on the factss of Life, so sad.[SEP] It is sad. She did have a long life though. She lived to 92. I hope I make it that long.
[SEP] Hello! How are you tonight?[SEP] Hi, I am doing great.  Do you want to chat about drama, television, or comedy?  It's your choice.

[SEP] The White House is at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C. and has been there since 1800 and I have never been.  Have you?[SEP] I've never been, though I want to go.The White House seems behind the curve technologically. W. had solar panels put back on the White House. Reagan had them taken off. I wonder why Clinton didn’t put them back on. Floppy disks? I wonder if they have laser printers yet. Or mice. 
[SEP] Good day. Do you follow politics?[SEP] I do.  It is hard not to follow it nowadays.  The president is always in the news
[SEP] I didn't know that The top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson[SEP] Neither did I, I wouldn't have guessed it was them. I've also never heard that until 1805 the runner up in the presidential election became V.P. Do you think they should bring this back?
[SEP] Did you know that Nevada is 86% owned by the government? [SEP] I figure that the govt must be doing something out in that desert. Experiment? Military games? Alien landings? LOL

[SEP] Hello there, do you follow politics much?[SEP] I do a little bit, but I think I like history more. I like knowing how it all works out. Like the first President to move into the White House was Thomas Jefferson in 1801.
[SEP] Do you watch the news and follow politics?[SEP] I do, I follow news on the government, It makes me mad when they try to censor free speech

That's ridiculous!

[SEP] Do you remember about the confidential informant in the Trump campaign?[SEP] I had a vague recollection of that.  It was an FBI spy, right?
[SEP] Do you play fantasy football? [SEP] I don't but my kids do. They love it. They just hate when their team has a bye week and they can play their favorite players! It hurts when Tom Brady has a bye week. LOL.

[SEP] Hey there, I found it pretty interesting that the Presidential runner-up became the Vice President until 1805 [SEP] Hi. I thought that was awesome too. But now they have more choice in who they can work with. I thought it was awesome that Canadian law requires radio stations to play Canadian music 40 percent of the time.

[SEP] Hi, how are you? Do you listen to the radio?[SEP] Hey, I'm great thanks! Yes I do! Did you know that according to Canadian law, all radios are required to play at least 40% Canadian music?
[SEP] Do you believe the news media and media in general is biased?[SEP] You would hope that it is not.  If one person had a platform to deliver a biased  message, no harm.  If a person owns a lot of platforms. Thats dangerous.
[SEP] do you know much about presidents?[SEP] Yes, I know that WIlson was the only one to have a PhD
[SEP] Do you subscribe to a print newspaper?[SEP] I do not subscribe to a print newspaper, but if I were the person in the first article I am not sure I would receive it anyone since the kid plowed the mailbox over.

[SEP] Do you own a car?[SEP] We do own a car, I have to drive the kids here, there and everywhere.
[SEP] Have you ever had to call New York using a rotary phone? [SEP] No I have actually never had to call someone in New York before. Come to think of it I have never used a rotaryphone. It's amazing to think that the inventor of the dial telephone was convinced phone operators routed his calls to rival businesses!
[SEP] do you like cars?[SEP] Love cars. DO you know who invented the drive thru?
[SEP] Hello![SEP] Hi there, are you a big car person?
[SEP] Fun fact: the top 3 wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington and Jefferson. I'm skeptical, how to you compare a horse to a limo?[SEP] And they accomplished that without releasing 3 pop albums while in office like inodesias president.
[SEP] Did you know that up until 1805, the runner-up to President of the US became the Veep?[SEP] Yeah,  i wish that was still a thing.  The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana

[SEP] Hi, how are you?\[SEP] Good, thanks, how are you?
[SEP] So, do you think it that maybe it would be better if our President were just the head of state instead of also the head of government?[SEP] I actually think it is pretty good how it is now. I was able to visit Washington DC recently and it very small compared to the guest house. I enjoyed looking at it though. HA
[SEP] hi, do you know much about presidents?[SEP] I know they live in the White House!
[SEP] Do you listen to the Radio? [SEP] Yes, mostly on my commute to and from work every day.
[SEP] Do you know any interesting facts about the presidents?[SEP] Good morning.  I might know a couple.  How about you?

[SEP] How are you? Did you know that a president is a title given to leaders of republican state?[SEP] i had no clue!The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana
[SEP] Hi.  Did you know the US President's guest house is larger that the White House?[SEP] I think I did hear that somewhere. I bet they use it a lot as well.
[SEP] Hello[SEP] Hi.  What do you think about Mr. Corallo's (Trump administration) claim?
[SEP] Good afternoon there partner. Have you ever seen the White House? I really want to go to Washington DC to check it out one day.[SEP] I have not but apparently you don't just have to go to Washington to see it. they have twin building,  ones in France and Ireland.  
[SEP] do you like the NFL?[SEP] i sure do. did you know women can play too?
[SEP] Hey did you hear how Trump called illegal immigrants animals recently[SEP] Hi, how are you? Did he? I'm not surprised. He shoots off his mouth a lot. He probably call them something different next time.

[SEP] hi how are you? do you listen to the radio?[SEP] I'm doing great thanks how are you? The radio is cool. Especially how it uses electromagnetic energy to transmit waves through space and produce sound.
[SEP] Are you comfortable talking about the government?[SEP] Sure, I think trump should be President Banana, instead of the President of Zimbabwe.
[SEP] Hello there, I hope you are doing well today.  Did you know what the first president of Zimbabwe was called?[SEP] The first president of Zimbabwe was know as President Banana, I wonder if he looked like one or just liked bananas a lot
[SEP] Hi, how are you?[SEP] Hello! Pretty good. Do you like the radio?
[SEP] Do you still listen to the radio?[SEP] I sure do! I've even herd that there are radio storms so strong on Jupiter they can be heard on an AM radio.
[SEP] Did you know that Trump is not among the 3 most wealthiest potus'?[SEP] I believe I did hear that. Even so, I'd like to have some of his money. I think it's admirable that he refuses to accept a salary.
[SEP] Have you ever seen Hope Hicks? I think she's very attractive.[SEP] No, I haven't, is she an actress or a performer or something?
[SEP] Do you like Trump as president?[SEP] Sure, I've also met Larry Kudlow. 
[SEP] Hey there partner. Isn't it crazy that we choose one leader to make decisions for 350 million people in our country![SEP] Yeah that is interesting. Luckily we don't automatically let the runner up in a presidential election become vice president anymore. That would be...interesting!
[SEP] Good morning, do you follow politics?[SEP] A bit
[SEP] Hi. Do you like to listen to the radio?[SEP] Sometimes. I used to listen to the radio a lot as a kid. Didn't have a TV, so not much choice there.

[SEP] How's it going, did you know the 3 wealthiest presidents were JFK, Washington, and Jefferson[SEP] Hello! I didn't know that, isn't it surprising that Donald Trump isn't one of the three wealthiest!
[SEP] Hi. Did you know that the White House has twin buildings in Ireland and France?[SEP] The White House does? I did not know that! So ol' 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue isn't as unique as I thought it was! There is also a replica in Atlanta which was built as a private home.
[SEP] I never knew that ringo starr narrated some episodes of thomas the thank engine.[SEP] Yes.     Funny that he was the more mild Narrator, compared to George Carlin and Alec Baldwin
[SEP] Hey how's it going? Did you hear about the police arresting the man who made threatening tweets against the football coach Jeff Brohm?[SEP] Yes, I did.  If the coach wanted to stay with Boilermakers,  it was not  his business. I wonder how the police found this guy.  Do you know who this guy is?

[SEP] I suppose you know that there are 32 teams in the NFL?[SEP] I knew there were a lot, but I don't think I knew the exact number. That makes sense though with how it's separated between the NFC and AFC
[SEP] did you know that there's a version of soccer where three teams face each other, at the same time? it's pretty cool[SEP] Wild game. I would love to see that and listen to the announcers trying to keep track of everything. Do they play with more than one ball?

[SEP] I am watching the news on television right now - do you remember when all of the tvs were black and white?[SEP] I don't remember that though I do remember having one black and white tv. Interesting that before WWII the TV was not commonplace in homes.

[SEP] hi, how are you? do you like football?[SEP] Yea I watch football all the time, it's a shame Alex Smith got injured but he can always fall back on something else considering he started his master's degree before being drafted

[SEP] hi, what do you know about the government?[SEP] Hello! I think government is interesting, they can have too much power though. Did you know 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the US government?

[SEP] Hi, do you listen to the radio much?[SEP] Not really. When I was younger I did. You?
[SEP] Do you follow what is happening in Colombia ?[SEP] I have a little bit.  The problem in South America is that all these socialist countries are realizing too late that socialism is a terrible way to govern!
[SEP] hey did you know the guest house is bigger than the white house itself[SEP] Yes, I did. I am not surprised. I did not know there is only one president with a phd.
[SEP] Did you know that Wikileaks published the government's plans to destroy Wikileaks? I guess that didn't work out so well.[SEP] Wow, didn't know that. Talk about spoiler alert. I heard a guy in France illegally sold the Eiffel Tower not just once, but twice.

[SEP] Hi, did you know that 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the Government?  If they were treated like US citizens, they would be forced to sell it to pay for their massive debts.[SEP] Yes, the government does own 86% of Nevada.  Not only that, but did you hear that in 2006, the US passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva Convention?
[SEP] Hey how are you, what do you think about Trump?[SEP] I have mixed feelings, I think he can do better in some aspects, how about you?
[SEP] I am glad that the Government is back for the next three weeks.[SEP] Me too, its a relief, hope things can settle now, did you hear the news about Alan Diaz?
[SEP] hey there what do you think of our government and constitution[SEP] I think that like everything, there is good and bad to it.  The bad for example, I find it odd that the US government owns 86% of Nevada.

[SEP] Hello, do you have a favorite football quarterback?[SEP] yes my favorite football qb is Aaron Rodgers.
[SEP] Hi do you like to dance? Even babies spontaneously dance when music is played for them.[SEP] Yes! I am not a big dancer. I think that as we age, we lose a lot of our childlike joy in things.

[SEP] Hey how's it going? What are your thoughts on the Trump administration so far? He definitely may go down as one of the wealthiest. The top 3 wealthiest are JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.[SEP] It is hard for me to imagine any president to be richer than Trump, but I guess adjusted for inflation, Washington and Jefferson are right up there
[SEP] Are you a fan of Trump?[SEP] Hi! I certainly can't believe he isn't one of the three wealthiest presidents of all time as that was Jefferson, Washington and JFK. What about you?

[SEP] Hi there.  I guess I will learn a bit about wrestling[SEP] So with the XFL, do you know much about that, it's new to me.

[SEP]Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence—perceiving, synthesizing, and inferring information—demonstrated by machines, as opposed to intelligence displayed by non-human animals and humans. Example tasks in which this is done include speech recognition, computer vision, translation between (natural) languages, as well as other mappings of inputs.
AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search), recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa), self-driving cars (e.g., Waymo), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go).
As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and in the years since has experienced several waves of optimism, followed by disappointment and the loss of funding (known as an "AI winter"), followed by new approaches, success and renewed funding. AI research has tried and discarded many different approaches since its founding, including simulating the brain, modeling human problem solving, formal logic, large databases of knowledge and imitating animal behavior. In the first decades of the 21st century, highly mathematical-statistical machine learning has dominated the field, and this technique has proved highly successful, helping to solve many challenging problems throughout industry and academia.The various sub-fields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. General intelligence (the ability to solve an arbitrary problem) is among the field's long-term goals. To solve these problems, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of problem-solving techniques – including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics. AI also draws upon computer science, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.
The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".
This raised philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethical consequences of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence; these issues have previously been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity. Computer scientists and philosophers have since suggested that AI may become an existential risk to humanity if its rational capacities are not steered towards beneficial goals.[SEP]Dublin (; Irish: Baile Átha Cliath, pronounced [ˈbˠalʲə aːhə ˈclʲiə] or [ˌbʲlʲaː ˈclʲiə]) is the capital and largest city of Ireland. On a bay at the mouth of the River Liffey, it is in the province of Leinster, bordered on the south by the Dublin Mountains, a part of the Wicklow Mountains range. At the 2016 census it had a population of 1,173,179, while the preliminary results of the 2022 census recorded that County Dublin as a whole had a population of 1,450,701, and that the population of the Greater Dublin Area was over 2 million, or roughly 40% of the Republic of Ireland's total population.A settlement was established in the area by the Gaels during or before the 7th century, followed by the Vikings. As the Kingdom of Dublin grew, it became Ireland's principal settlement by the 12th century Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. The city expanded rapidly from the 17th century and was briefly the second largest in the British Empire and sixth largest in Western Europe after the Acts of Union in 1800. Following independence in 1922, Dublin became the capital of the Irish Free State, renamed Ireland in 1937.
Dublin is a centre for education, arts and culture, administration and industry. As of 2018, the city was listed by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network (GaWC) as a global city, with a ranking of "Alpha minus", which places it as one of the top thirty cities in the world.[SEP]The United Arab Emirates (UAE; Arabic: اَلْإِمَارَات الْعَرَبِيَة الْمُتَحِدَة al-ʾImārāt al-ʿArabīyah al-Muttaḥidah), or simply the Emirates (Arabic: الِْإمَارَات al-ʾImārāt), is a country in Western Asia (The Middle East). It is located at the eastern end of the Arabian Peninsula and shares borders with Oman and Saudi Arabia, while having maritime borders in the Persian Gulf with Qatar and Iran. Abu Dhabi is the nation's capital, while Dubai, the most populous city, is an international hub.
The United Arab Emirates is an elective monarchy formed from a federation of seven emirates, consisting of Abu Dhabi (the capital), Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm Al Quwain. Each emirate is governed by an emir and together the emirs form the Federal Supreme Council. The members of the Federal Supreme Council elect a president and vice president from among their members. In practice, the emir of Abu Dhabi serves as president while the ruler of Dubai is vice president and also prime minister. In 2013, the country had a population of 9.2 million, of which 1.4 million were Emirati citizens and 7.8 million were expatriates. As of 2020, the United Arab Emirates has an estimated population of roughly 9.9 million.The area which is today the United Arab Emirates has been inhabited for over 125,000 years. It has been the crossroads of trading for many civilizations, including Mesopotamia, Persia, and India.Islam is the official religion and Arabic  the official language. The United Arab Emirates' oil and natural gas reserves are the world's sixth and seventh-largest, respectively. Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and the country's first president, oversaw the development of the Emirates by investing oil revenues into healthcare, education, and infrastructure. The United Arab Emirates has the most diversified economy among the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. In the 21st century, the country has become less reliant on oil and gas and is economically focusing on tourism and business. The government does not levy income tax, although there is a corporate tax in place and a 5% value-added tax was established in 2018.Human rights groups, such as Amnesty International, Freedom House and Human Rights Watch, regard UAE as generally substandard on human rights, with citizens criticising the regime imprisoned and tortured, families harassed by the state security apparatus, and cases of forced disappearances. Individual rights such as the freedoms of assembly, association, the press, expression, and religion are also severely repressed.The UAE is considered a middle power. It is a member of the United Nations, Arab League, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, OPEC, Non-Aligned Movement, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).[SEP]Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is home to many extremely tall modern high-rises, 108 of which stand taller than 180 metres (591 ft). The tallest building in Dubai is the Burj Khalifa, which rises 828 metres (2,717 ft) and contains 163 floors. The tower has stood as both the tallest building in the world and the tallest man-made structure of any kind in the world since its completion in January 2010. The second-tallest building in Dubai is the 425-metre (1,394 ft) Marina 101, which also stands as the world's fourth tallest residential skyscraper. The skyscrapers of Dubai are, for the most part, clustered in three different locations. The land along E 11 Road was the first to develop, followed by the Dubai Marina neighborhood and the Business Bay district.
Overall, Dubai has 18 completed and topped-out buildings that rise at least 300 metres (984 ft) in height, which is more than any other city in the world. Dubai has 73 completed and topped-out buildings that rise at least 200 metres (656 ft) in height. Based on the average height of the ten tallest completed buildings, Dubai has the tallest skyline in the Middle East and the world. As of 2012, the skyline of Dubai is ranked eighth in the world with 248 buildings rising at least 100 metres (330 ft) in height.The history of skyscrapers in Dubai began with the construction of Dubai World Trade Centre in 1979, which is usually regarded as the first high-rise in the city. At the time of its completion, it also stood as the tallest building in the Middle East. Since 1999, and especially from 2005 onwards, Dubai has been the site of an extremely large skyscraper building boom, with all 73 of its buildings over 200 metres (656 ft) tall completed after 1999. In less than ten years, the city has amassed one of the largest skylines in the world; it is now home to the world's tallest building, the world's tallest residence, and the world's second tallest hotel. As of 2019, 49 new skyscrapers are under construction in Dubai; additionally, there are over 127 active high-rise developments that have been proposed for construction in the city.[SEP]Abu Dhabi (UK: , US: ; Arabic: أَبُو ظَبِي Abū Ẓabī Arabic pronunciation: [ɐˈbuˈðˤɑbi]) is the capital and second-most populous city (after Dubai) of the United Arab Emirates. It is also the capital of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and the centre of the Abu Dhabi Metropolitan Area.
The city of Abu Dhabi is located on an island in the Persian Gulf, off the Central West Coast. Most of the city and the Emirate reside on the mainland connected to the rest of the country. As of 2021, Abu Dhabi's urban area had an estimated population of 1.5 million, out of 2.9 million in the emirate of Abu Dhabi, as of 2016. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is headquartered in the city, and was the world's 5th largest sovereign wealth fund in 2021. Abu Dhabi itself has over a trillion US dollars worth of assets under management in a combination of various sovereign wealth funds headquartered there.Abu Dhabi houses local and federal government offices and is the home of the United Arab Emirates Government and the Supreme Petroleum Council. The city is home to the President of the UAE, who is a member of the Al Nahyan family. Abu Dhabi's rapid development and urbanization, coupled with the massive oil and gas reserves and production and relatively high average income, have transformed it into a large, developed metropolis. It is the country's center of politics and industry, and a major culture and commerce center. Abu Dhabi accounts for about two-thirds of the roughly $503 billion UAE economy.[SEP]Saudi Arabia, officially the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), is a country in Southwestern Asia. It covers the bulk of the Arabian Peninsula, and has a land area of about 2,150,000 km2 (830,000 sq mi), making it the fifth-largest country in Asia, the second-largest in the Arab world, and the largest in Western Asia and the Middle East. It is bordered by the Red Sea to the west; Jordan, Iraq, and Kuwait to the north; the Persian Gulf, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates to the east; Oman to the southeast; and Yemen to the south. Bahrain is an island country off the east coast. The Gulf of Aqaba in the northwest separates Saudi Arabia from Egypt. Saudi Arabia is the only country with a coastline along both the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, and most of its terrain consists of arid desert, lowland, steppe, and mountains. Its capital and largest city is Riyadh. The country is home to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest cities in Islam.
Pre-Islamic Arabia, the territory that constitutes modern-day Saudi Arabia, was the site of several ancient cultures and civilizations; the prehistory of Saudi Arabia shows some of the earliest traces of human activity in the world. The world's second-largest religion, Islam, emerged in what is now Saudi Arabia. In the early 7th century, the Islamic prophet Muhammad united the population of Arabian Peninsula and created a single Islamic religious polity. Following his death in 632, his followers rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim rule beyond Arabia, conquering huge and unprecedented swathes of territory (from the Iberian Peninsula in the west to parts of Central and South Asia in the east) in a matter of decades. Arab dynasties originating from modern-day Saudi Arabia founded the Rashidun (632–661), Umayyad (661–750), Abbasid (750–1517), and Fatimid (909–1171) caliphates, as well as numerous other dynasties in Asia, Africa, and Europe.
The area of modern-day Saudi Arabia formerly consisted of mainly four distinct historical regions: Hejaz, Najd, and parts of Eastern Arabia (Al-Ahsa) and South Arabia ('Asir). The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia was founded in 1932 by King Abdulaziz (known as Ibn Saud in the West). He united the four regions into a single state through a series of conquests beginning in 1902 with the capture of Riyadh, the ancestral home of his family, the House of Saud. Saudi Arabia has since been an absolute monarchy, where political decisions are made on the basis of consultation among the King, the Council of Ministers, and the country’s traditional elites that oversee a highly authoritarian regime. The ultraconservative Wahhabi religious movement within Sunni Islam has been described as a "predominant feature of Saudi culture", although the power of the religious establishment has been significantly eroded in the 2010s. In its Basic Law, Saudi Arabia continues to define itself as a sovereign Arab Islamic state with Islam as its official religion, Arabic as its official language, and Riyadh as its capital.
Petroleum was discovered in 1938 and followed up by several other finds in the Eastern Province. Saudi Arabia has since become the world's second-largest oil producer (behind the US) and the world's largest oil exporter, controlling the world's second-largest oil reserves and the fourth-largest gas reserves. The kingdom is categorized as a World Bank high-income economy and is the only Arab country to be part of the G20 major economies. The state has attracted criticism for a variety of reasons, including its role in the Yemeni Civil War, alleged sponsorship of Islamic terrorism and its poor human rights record, including the excessive and often extrajudicial use of capital punishment.Saudi Arabia is considered both a regional and middle power. The Saudi economy is the largest in the Middle East; the world's eighteenth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the seventeenth-largest by PPP. As a country with a very high Human Development Index, it offers a tuition-free university education, no personal income tax, and a free universal health care system. Saudi Arabia is home to the world's third-largest immigrant population. It also has one of the world's youngest populations, with approximately 50 per cent of its population of 34.2 million being under 25 years old. In addition to being a member of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Saudi Arabia is an active and founding member of the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, Arab League, Arab Air Carriers Organization and OPEC.[SEP]The Burj Khalifa (; Arabic: برج خليفة, Arabic pronunciation: [bʊrd͡ʒ xaˈliːfa], Khalifa Tower), known as the Burj Dubai prior to its inauguration in 2010, is a skyscraper in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It is known for being the world's tallest building. With a total height of 829.8 m (2,722 ft, or just over half a mile) and a roof height (excluding antenna, but including a 242.6 m spire) of 828 m (2,717 ft), the Burj Khalifa has been the tallest structure and building in the world since its topping out in 2009, supplanting Taipei 101, the previous holder of that status.Construction of the Burj Khalifa began in 2004, with the exterior completed five years later in 2009. The primary structure is reinforced concrete and some of the structural steel for the building originated from the Palace of the Republic in East Berlin, the former East German parliament. The building was opened in 2010 as part of a new development called Downtown Dubai. It was designed to be the centerpiece of large-scale, mixed-use development. The decision to construct the building was based on the government's decision to diversify from an oil-based economy, and for Dubai to gain international recognition. The building is named in honor of the former president of the United Arab Emirates, Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Abu Dhabi and the UAE government lent Dubai money to pay its debts. The building broke numerous height records, including its designation as the tallest building in the world.
Burj Khalifa was designed by a team led by Adrian Smith of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, the firm that designed the Sears Tower in Chicago, a previous record holder for the world's tallest building. Hyder Consulting was chosen to be the supervising engineer with NORR Group Consultants International Limited chosen to supervise the architecture of the project. The design is derived from the Islamic architecture of the region, such as in the Great Mosque of Samarra. The Y-shaped tripartite floor geometry is designed to optimize residential and hotel space. A buttressed central core and wings are used to support the height of the building. Although this design was derived from Tower Palace III, the Burj Khalifa's central core houses all vertical transportation except egress stairs within each of the wings. The structure also features a cladding system which is designed to withstand Dubai's hot summer temperatures. It contains a total of 57 elevators and 8 escalators.
At a certain point in the architectural and engineering process, the original Emaar developers experienced financial problems and required more money and economic funding. Sheikh Khalifa, the then-ruler of the United Arab Emirates, granted monetary aid and funding, hence the changing of the name from "Burj Dubai" to "Burj Khalifa". The concept of profitability derived from building high-density developments and malls around the landmark has proven successful. Its surrounding malls, hotels, and condominiums in Downtown Dubai have generated the most revenue from the project as a whole, while the Burj Khalifa itself made little or no profit.The critical reception of Burj Khalifa has been generally positive, and the building has received many awards. However, there were numerous complaints concerning migrant workers from South Asia who were the primary building labour force. These centered on low wages and the practice of confiscating passports until duties were complete.[SEP]Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, is home to many extremely tall modern high-rises, 108 of which stand taller than 180 metres (591 ft).

[SEP]What discovery in the early 1960s was the impetus for unification of the Emirates?[SEP]
Prior to the discovery of oil, one of the primary exports of the region had been pearls, an industry that had sustained the sheikhs for millennia. The advent of World War I and the development by the Japanese of cultured pearls all but destroyed the industry.
Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan (1918-2004) became the ruler of Abu Dhabi in 1966 and was the driving force behind the unification of the emirates. With oil interests being lost to U.S. companies, the answer to that problem lay in unifying their interests and protecting their own resources from foreign control. The new constitution was put in place in 1971, forming the UAE from the former 'Trucial States.[SEP]
