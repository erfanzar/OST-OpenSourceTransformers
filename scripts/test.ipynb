I think the guest house is newer.\\n[SEP] Hey have you ever been to a concert?[SEP] Lots! Lucky to have come from a family that was very into music.

Are you a concert-goer?\\n[SEP] Hello there, did you know the white house is smaller than the guest house?[SEP] I have heard this fact. I don\\'t know how Donald J Trump lives with it. He would resent the unfairness of the situation.\\n[SEP] Hi there! Do you enjoy live music?[SEP] Hi, I do when I have the chance yes! I like piano jazz.

[SEP] I think it is worse because the runner up is no longer involved.

[SEP] That\\'s unreal,  I guess they had only two places to be either on stage or on the tour bus; no time for anything else.  While concerts are generally loud, some are louder than others. Did you know the Foo Fighters did a concert in New Zealand that was so loud it was picked up on seismic monitors?\\n[SEP] Hi, are you into cars, radios, or clothing?[SEP] I love cars. Do you know how Cadillac got its name?\\n[SEP] Hello, How are you?[SEP] Hello, I am good.  How are you?  Did you know that Apple had a clothing line in 1986?\\n[SEP] Hi there what do you know about the White House?[SEP] I know that the Guest House is bigger than the white house. \\n[SEP] Do you enjoy cars?[SEP] I lease a car but I do not own a car and I don\\'t care too much for cars. I am very interested in sociopolitical events, though, and I am deeply saddened to hear of the news that Detective Jacai Colson was killed under friendly fire. Did you hear about this?\\n[SEP] An undercover detective holding his badge and shouting \"police, police\" was shot and killed by police in Maryland.[SEP] Cat-like reflexes, trained to perform at the highest level, equipped with the finest weapons and trained to distinguish between friend and foe...did this to a fellow law enforcement professional. This is dangerous work with genuine risk. My hearts go out to all involved. Were there flame throwers involved? If this was South Africa, cars can legally be equipped with those.  Talk about deterrent!\\n[SEP] So what do you think about president trump?[SEP] I\\'m not a fan of the way he is going about things but I respect the office of president. \\n[SEP] Hi, how are you?[SEP] I\\'m great! How are you?\\n[SEP] I got an interesting article about Trump,[SEP] Oh?  What\\'s he saying now?\\n[SEP] I wonder what the media would say about Teddy Rosevelt and Quincy Adams not using a Bible at their inaugurals today[SEP] They would probably applaud for the most part.  I find it amazing that Jefferson cut out the supernatural parts of the Bible.\\n[SEP] Hello, what do you prefer? Republics or Kingdoms?[SEP] I would prefer a republic. There is an election of representatives.\\n[SEP] Hello,  how are you ? The first president of zimbabwe was called president banana[SEP] I am well. That\\'s pretty funny! The top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson\\n[SEP] Interesting to learn more about Tondo. There population of 200,000 people or more[SEP] I believe that is in Manila and is a slum. Many of the residents live in 50-square-foot shacks which I cannot imagine. \\n[SEP] Do you have an Apple computer?[SEP] I don\\'t, but I use an Iphone. Why? \\n[SEP] Hi! Hope you\\'re having a good day. Have you been following all the drama around Michael Cohen??[SEP] No, who is he? \\n[SEP] The ACLU claims to not support either political party.  Huge lie.

What do you think about Mark Zuckerberg?[SEP] I think that he is a dude who is in charge of a massively different product that he anticipated\\n[SEP] Hi! Do you use facebook?[SEP] I do not use Facebook. It has poor policies about privacy. Do you use Facebook?\\n[SEP] Hello. Do you use Facebook?[SEP] Hello there, I do and use it about once a day.

How about you?[SEP] I spend a little time on it looking at how to videos. What do you watch?\\n[SEP] I got so angry when I heard about that black man getting arrested[SEP] I feel the same way. I don\\'t know how they could smell marijuana in his pocket.\\n[SEP] Do you like to listen to the radio?[SEP] I do, usually while driving.  Nothing like that Finnish station which broadcasts in classical Latin though.\\n[SEP] Hello, have you watched the series 13 Reasons Why?[SEP] I have not, have you?\\n[SEP] Do you use television for entertainment?[SEP] no, I am more into streaming. I really like Netflix.\\n[SEP] Wow I wonder why Orange is the new black is so noteworthy. I have never seen one episode, have you?[SEP] I have, I like it, too bad the series got cancelled.\\n[SEP] Do you have a favorite Netflix show?

How about you?\\n[SEP] Netflix is an American media service found in 1997 by Reed hastings and Marc randolph.[SEP] That\\'s quite interesting. Do you have a Netflix subscription?\\n[SEP] Have you heard about the Orange is the New Black Cancellation?  They are cancelling after seven seasons.[SEP] i guess they ran out of stories. i dont really know the show. seven seasons? that is a good run.\\n[SEP] Have you watched \"13 Reasons Why\" on Netflix?[SEP] I have not, but lets talk about Netflix.

Can you believe the three wealthiest presidents of all time were Jefferson, Washington and JFK?[SEP] Hi! Washington and jFK makes sense, this is probably a bit out of date (i.e., Trump).

You a basketball fan? I used to play a lot. I like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar he was very dominant. His dunk was crazy.[SEP] Yes I am a basketball fan. I follow the NBA more than I follow college basketball. Who is your favorite team?\\n[SEP] There are so very odd facts about the united states government. I wonder if the same can be said for other countries. [SEP] I\\'m sure there is. I find it odd that every US president with a beard has been Republican. \\n[SEP] Hello! Do you have a favorite football team?[SEP] hi, how are you? no i dont. i dont really know the sport well. You?\\n[SEP] Hi!  Do you follow the government?[SEP] A little the Republican party is also called the GOP.\\n[SEP] Hello there![SEP] Hello, do you know Paul Manafort, former Trump campain chairman\\n[SEP] Hi, how are you?

I don\\'t like all the negativity although I am guilty of getting news form social media like facebook.\\n[SEP] What are your thoughs on media?[SEP] I think it\\'s very important for people to stay informed and also as equally important to not be biased by what you see and that certain publications are biased vs others, what about you?\\n[SEP] Good morning! Are you a fan of football?[SEP] Good morning. Yes. which is your favourite football team ?\\n[SEP] do you like the band Kiss? I like them a lot, I guess they bought into an arena football team[SEP] I do enjoy their music.  I think its cool that they offered a contract to Tim Tebow to play.\\n[SEP] Have you heard that Trump is apparently worried over the Manafort trial? It\\'s been in the news lately.[SEP] Yeah, Paul Manafort is quite the character, as is Trump. Trump was evidently quoted saying he didn\\'t understand why the government didn\\'t tell him Manafort was under investigation.\\n[SEP] What do you think about the company Trump keeps like Paul manafort?[SEP] I think it is questionable.  Obviously the problem is two-fold for Trump.  The types he associates with and when he endorses someone, that stamp of approval does not mean much.\\n[SEP] Hi! Are you a football fan?[SEP] I watch some football on occasion.\\n[SEP] Hi! Do you follow the government at all? I find it awfully ironic that Wikileaks published the government\\'s plans to destroy them. Ha![SEP] I\\'ve always followed the government closely.

Do you?\\n[SEP] Do you have an interest in politics?[SEP] Yes I do, why are Americans so hard on president Trump?\\n[SEP] Do you follow politics?[SEP] Yes, I dont like Trump, how about you?\\n[SEP] \"The mistrust of the media is so extreme among Republicans that 40 percent consider otherwise accurate news stories to be \"fake news\" if the stories cast a politician or political group in a negative light. \" I find that number to be really more than I thought...[SEP] Do you think the news is fake?\\n[SEP] Hello,  hows it going?  did you know the Presidents guest house is bigger than the white house?  That is crazy![SEP] I did hear that. pomp and circumstance. Apparently the president of Indonesia has 3 pop album. \\n[SEP] Iowa\\'s guest locker room for football teams is painted pink, hilarious![SEP] LOL.  I know all about it being a Nebraska fan who has had teams play there!  Are you a fan of football?\\n[SEP] do you know much about presidents?[SEP] I know some stuff. DO you know who are the three wealthiest us presidents?\\n[SEP] Do you get a lot of news from the media?[SEP] I try to stick with larger media outlets.  I follow news aggregators, like Drudge and then for issues I am interested, I get info from different sources to weed out biases.  Media is still important but needs to report more and opine less.  I think that\\'s the gist of the Gallup poll.  Your thoughts?\\n[SEP] Episcopal High School is great for learning football and bonding as a team.  It is very diverse as well.[SEP] Yeah I heard it is a good school.  I guess the student population there is 445. \\n[SEP] Hello. How are you?[SEP] Hey!  I am doing well, enjoying my Sunday.

I don\\'t really watch much TV\\n[SEP] Hey! Did you hear that actress Charlotte Rae passed, she was the house mother on the factss of Life, so sad.[SEP] It is sad. She did have a long life though. She lived to 92. I hope I make it that long.\\n[SEP] Hello! How are you tonight?[SEP] Hi, I am doing great.  Do you want to chat about drama, television, or comedy?  It\\'s your choice.\\n[SEP] hi, do you like comedy?[SEP] I do, I think comedy is a great genre what about you?\\n[SEP] Hello do you subscribe to Netflix?[SEP] Hello, yes i do have Netflix!

Have you?[SEP] I\\'ve never been, though I want to go.The White House seems behind the curve technologically. W. had solar panels put back on the White House. Reagan had them taken off. I wonder why Clinton didn’t put them back on. Floppy disks? I wonder if they have laser printers yet. Or mice. \\n[SEP] Good day. Do you follow politics?[SEP] I do.  It is hard not to follow it nowadays.  The president is always in the news\\n[SEP] I didn\\'t know that The top three wealthiest presidents in american history were jfk, washington, and jefferson[SEP] Neither did I, I wouldn\\'t have guessed it was them. I\\'ve also never heard that until 1805 the runner up in the presidential election became V.P. Do you think they should bring this back?\\n[SEP] Did you know that Nevada is 86% owned by the government? [SEP] I figure that the govt must be doing something out in that desert. Experiment? Military games? Alien landings? LOL\\n[SEP] Hi, how are you doing on this fine day?[SEP] Hi! I am doing great and just finished catching up on the news, how about you?\\n[SEP] Hello.

Did you know the Eiffel Tower was sold twice?\\n[SEP] hi there, do you know much about the presidents?[SEP] I know a little. How about you?\\n[SEP] hey there, do you know much about politics?[SEP] About average but I do stay informed.  For example, Trump seems to be following precedent in regard to mixing business and recreation on travel.\\n[SEP] Hello there, do you follow politics much?[SEP] I do a little bit, but I think I like history more. I like knowing how it all works out. Like the first President to move into the White House was Thomas Jefferson in 1801.\\n[SEP] Do you watch the news and follow politics?[SEP] I do, I follow news on the government, It makes me mad when they try to censor free speech\\n[SEP] Do you ever pay attention to the news articles about Trump\\'s tweets?[SEP] Yes I have. \\n[SEP] Hello!

I suppose Ailes didn\\'t understand the Streisand Effect, perhaps due to the fact that he\\'s an older guy and not super familiar with the internet. [SEP] Not a huge fan of Fox News. Even more surprising that they\\'re more watched than CNN and MSNBC combined.\\n[SEP] Do you watch fox News?[SEP] I try not to, I find them a bit slanted.  \\n[SEP] Hi do you watch Fox news?[SEP] Yes sometimes.

Winning the heisman is a big accomplishment \\n[SEP] I am watching the news on television right now - do you remember when all of the tvs were black and white?[SEP] I don\\'t remember that though I do remember having one black and white tv.

Are you a fan of our president?\\n[SEP] Hello - do you follow government?[SEP] I like to stay involved I am afraid ot those deaths over in Maryland and North Virignia\\n[SEP] Good morning.

Could you imagine if our president had biker group that was almost a military arm and really supported him?

The problem in South America is that all these socialist countries are realizing too late that socialism is a terrible way to govern!\\n[SEP] hey did you know the guest house is bigger than the white house itself[SEP] Yes, I did. I am not surprised. I did not know there is only one president with a phd.\\n[SEP] Did you know that Wikileaks published the government\\'s plans to destroy Wikileaks?

What do you think of our president and our govt?\\n[SEP] hey there, do you listen to ej radio?[SEP] No, I never heard of it. Maybe someone is trying to censor it, like the Chineese government censored the word censorship.\\n[SEP] Hi, did you know that 86% of the land in Nevada is owned by the Government?  If they were treated like US citizens, they would be forced to sell it to pay for their massive debts.[SEP] Yes, the government does own 86% of Nevada.  Not only that, but did you hear that in 2006, the US passed legislation that would protect government employees from being prosecuted for violating the Geneva Convention?\\n[SEP] Hey how are you, what do you think about Trump?[SEP] I have mixed feelings, I think he can do better in some aspects, how about you?\\n[SEP] I am glad that the Government is back for the next three weeks.[SEP] Me too, its a relief, hope things can settle now, did you hear the news about Alan Diaz?\\n[SEP] hey there what do you think of our government and constitution[SEP] I think that like everything, there is good and bad to it.

Even babies spontaneously dance when music is played for them.[SEP] Yes! I am not a big dancer.

He definitely may go down as one of the wealthiest. The top 3 wealthiest are JFK, Washington, and Jefferson.[SEP] It is hard for me to imagine any president to be richer than Trump, but I guess adjusted for inflation, Washington and Jefferson are right up there\\n[SEP] Are you a fan of Trump?[SEP] Hi!
